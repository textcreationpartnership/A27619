         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>I Have often had it in my Thoughts and Deſires, to open this Great Parable of the Kingdom to you: Wherein (as Chriſt ſaith) he hath declared things, that had been kept ſecret from the very Foundation of the World.</p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:41902:4"/>
                     <p>But, indeed, I fear an Inability to open this Parable, according to the Greateſt Importance and Senſe of it.</p>
                     <p>I have yet, by the Aſſiſtance of God, and through the Great Author of it, undertaken to offer to you the utmoſt of Light that I can, from ſo Rich a Portion of Scripture; But ſtill ſaying, <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> I know, it contains in it ſelf a Point of the Greateſt Concernment to every one of us: And the Greater, and the Fairer our Profeſſion of Chriſtianity is, the Greater is our Obligation to conſider it. For, you ſee, here is nothing in the Text but a <hi>Virgin-State;</hi> and that imports the Purity of a Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; the Higheſt and the Pureſt Profeſſion of Chriſt and of his Name. And yet, as you may eaſily obſerve, what a great Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Hazard there is in the Pureſt Profeſſion, that we ſhould come ſhort of the Great End. For why were Five of theſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins ſhut for ever out of the Glory and Happineſs of the End?</p>
                     <p>The Point that I aim at to diſcourſe upon, I'll give you in the General: And then ſhew you, in every Particular, how the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Anſwers to it; And how Great the Wiſdom of Chriſt is. He ſpake indeed (as it is ſaid in the Goſpel) <hi>as never man ſpake.</hi> No meer Created Man was ever able to find out ſuch Lively Images and Repreſentations of Things as he did; and as he hath given us the Inſtance and Example of, in this very Parable. I ſay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, here is the main Point that <hi>I</hi> propoſe to you:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That even the Higheſt, and moſt Excellent Profeſſors of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, have great need, and an Obligation lying upon them, to take care, that while they make ſo excellent a Profeſſion, they have that, that will bear out, and will laſt in that State of the Kingdom of Chriſt; and of the Glory of it; I ſay, the Higheſt and Pureſt Profeſſors.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Suppoſe any of us ſay, We are not as Heathens; and we are not as Antichriſtians; and we are not as the Looſer and General Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Chriſtianity are: But we are Virgins; we are of the Pureſt, and of the moſt Refined Profeſſion of Chriſtianity.</p>
                     <p>Our Lord here allows it to us; we may be ſo, and yet, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this; we are to be under this ſevere Caution, <hi>That we are not found fooliſh Virgins,</hi> that have not the Truth and Power of Chriſtianity, or only a Profeſſion that will go out, as a Lamp extinguiſhed and quenched, and caſt out into utter Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when it comes to the ſtricteſt and higheſt Examination.</p>
                     <p>Now this our Saviour hath comprized under Three Generals, that you may obſerve in this Parable, which I will at this time,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41902:4"/> (firſt of all, but in groſs, and in ſhort) deliver to you; and then, Endeavour, by the Aſſiſtance of God, to be more Exact upon the Particulars of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Therefore, that we may underſtand it, we are to obſerve, That this Parable repreſents the Kingdom of Heaven; and, the Kingdom of Heaven is to be underſtood, <hi>Firſt,</hi> In the opening of it, in the Preaching of the Goſpel, and in the drawing of the Minds and Hearts of thoſe that hear it, unto it. That's the firſt Notion of the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven ſhall be likened unto Ten Virgins, which took their Lamps, and went forth to meet the Bridegroom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This ſpeaks the whole State of the Goſpel, from that Fulneſs of Time, as I have Stiled it, from the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> to the Fulneſs of Times, or of All Times; from the time of the Death and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> from that time, 'till the Bridegroom him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf comes. The Kingdom of Heaven, It is the Preaching of the Goſpel daily and continually, to all thoſe to whom it is offered and tendred. And as to this, <hi>He that hath an Ear to hear, let him hear.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Kingdom of Heaven, it is to be conſidered, As it ſhall open it ſelf in the Glory of the Appearance of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> For, the Kingdom of Heaven doth not loſe it ſelf, when the Preaching of the Goſpel is at an end, and when that, which we count the Day of Judgment, comes; but it paſſes then into another State, into its Glory, and into its viſible Appearance: It comes then into the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Celebration of the Nuptials, and of the Wedding.</p>
                     <p>For, they went forth to meet the Bridegtoom. And it is ſaid, That the Bridegroom came, and they that were ready, went in with him into the Wedding, and the Door was ſhut. So the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven laſts from that Preaching of the Goſpel, from the Death and Reſurrection of Chriſt, unto the Glory of the Kingdom, in the Appearance of Chriſt, and of all his Saints with him. Which (as I ſay, and as you ſhall after hear) is the higheſt Celebration of the Wedding, and of the Nuptials.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Head of Diſcourſe on this Parable, in which our Lord hath preſented this great Truth to us, is the Repreſentation of thoſe that make Profeſſion of him, in the pureſt, and in the moſt refined way; and therefore they are all called Virgins: Even thoſe that had not Oil in their Lamps; yet ſtill they are called Virgins.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41902:5"/> And thoſe that were not only the wiſe, but the fooliſh; ſtill they are called Virgins. And what is the Reaſon of this? but that Chriſt might preſs the harder and cloſer upon every one of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.</p>
                     <p>If you ſay (and you know we are ready to value and rate our ſelves by it) we have a better Profeſſion, and a better Worſhip; and we do not as others do, whoſe way, and whoſe worſhip, and whoſe profeſſion we condemn; but we are as Virgins in our Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Therefore I ſay, Chriſt hath given us the whole Frame of the Doctrine, in a Parable of Virgins; in a Repreſentation of a Virgin-ſtate. Indeed, in ſome places of Scripture, this Metaphor, or Reſemblance of a Virgin, imports the Truth, and the power of Grace; and where there is no want of all that Excellency of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, that is neceſſary to the Perfection, and to the Glory of it, in this preſent State, but here it is otherwiſe; and it is to this very purpoſe, that none of us might reſt in an outward Profeſſion. And therefore we may obſerve the ſeveral particulars under this Virgin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, that our Lord hath Repreſented.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt</hi> of all, That <hi>Five</hi> were <hi>Wiſe,</hi> and <hi>Five</hi> were <hi>Fooliſh.</hi> And then,</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Second Place,</hi> Wherein the Wiſdom of the <hi>one,</hi> and Folly of the <hi>other</hi> conſiſted. The Wiſdom was, in taking Oil in the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, with their Lamps: The Folly was, in taking no Oil with them, but only in their Lamps; but thinking to make a ſhift (as we ſay) with what was in the Profeſſion.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Third Place,</hi> We have the Conſideration of their Behaviour, or of their State, in the Time between the Preaching of the Goſpel firſt, and then, the Glory of the Nuptials. While the Bridegroom tarried, they all ſlumbred and ſlept.</p>
                     <p>I muſt indeed let you know, That I Interpret this otherwiſe, than the Generality of thoſe that have Spoken or Written upon it, have done. For this Slumbring and Sleeping, I do not look upon as the ſame; that they were in a Spiritual Slumber, not Sleep; but I look upon it only as ſuitable to the Parable, to be a Repreſentation of the dying of thoſe that make Profeſſion of Chriſtianity; that is, throughout the Time, that great Space of Time between thoſe two Points, <hi>viz.</hi> the fulneſs of Time, and the fulneſs of all Times. There are many gone out of the World, many of thoſe that were Virgins in their Profeſſion; and they then Slumbred; then Slept; that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41902:5"/> is, they have died, and gone out of the World, in this State of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
                     <p>Now, the Reaſon that I give, why I ſhould ſo Interpretet, is this; Becauſe it is very plain, by what our Saviour ſpeaks, That the wiſe Virgins did never Spiritually Sleep; they were not in a Spiritual Sleep; that is, It was not the Character of their State.</p>
                     <p>And therefore I look upon it only thus, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, They had come and gone from the place of Judgment. So I ſay, they had come, and gone out of the State of the World, and the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſtianity; and they have entred into a State, which to us that are here in the World, looks like Mid-Night Sleeping. As now, if we ſpeak of the Apoſtles that have died; they have (as it were) deeply Slept, ever ſince the time that they went out of the World. And ſo the Saints that we have known here in the World; we may ſay as the Scripture doth, <hi>They fell aſleep;</hi> and there has been a Slumber upon them as to their Profeſſion; they have not manifeſted that LIFE and POWER of Chriſtianity. And then in the Fourth Place; here's the Caſe, and the State of theſe Virgins, upon the coming of the Bridegroom. At Midnight there was a Cry made, <hi>Behold, the Bridegroom cometh: Go ye forth to meet him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And that I look upon, to be intended of the Reſurrection. <hi>That voice of the Son of God; That they that are in the Graves ſhall hear; and they that hear ſhall live, and they ſhall come forth out of their Graves.</hi> The <hi>wiſe</hi> and the <hi>fooliſh</hi> Virgins, they die alike, and they come forth out of their Graves; that is, both the one and the other Riſe again, and appear before Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Fifth</hi> Place; as ſoon as the Bodies, and Souls or Spirits, are Re-united; immediately, all thoſe that are raiſed, go to the Trimming of their Lamps; that is, they immediately Reflect upon what they had been doing here in the World; how they had Lived, what they had Acted; how they had anſwered their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. They ariſe, and Trim their Lamps; they come with that Profeſſion of Chriſtianity they have made.</p>
                     <p>And that's the Second Head of Diſcourſe in this Parable. And then,</p>
                     <p>The Third is, the Reſult, Iſſue, and Event of all this. What was the different State then, of the <hi>Wiſe,</hi> and of the <hi>Fooliſh?</hi> As ſoon as ever the Fooliſh Virgins came to tryal of their Lamps; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41902:6"/> they found a want of Oil. They found a want of that Power, of that Glory, of that Life of Chriſtianity, that ſhould bear them up in the Time of the Wedding, of the Glory of the Kingdom of Chriſt. And therefore, that you may underſtand this Parable, you muſt conſider, That amongſt thoſe <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Nations, their great Solemnities were in the Night; their great Nuptial Feaſts, and their great Entertainments; they were in the Night: And ſo, every one did (as it were) bring their Lamps. Here is the curious Colour and Art of the Parable, or the Picture; every Perſon that came to thoſe Night-Entertainments? which were their greateſt; As I tell you, They brought with them, a Lamp, a Light to ſtand by them; and that ſo the Glory of the Feaſt, or of the Entertainment, might ariſe from thoſe many Lights that were ſhining together, that every one brought.</p>
                     <p>Now, therefore (ſaith Chriſt) the Fooliſh Virgins, came with their Lamps, and they had no Oil; they had no Oil to bear out the Glory of the Feaſt, the Glory of the Wedding, of that great Nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, the <hi>Marriage-Supper of the Lamb,</hi> as it is called, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.</p>
                     <p>So, as ſoon as ever they found the want of Oil, they were in an Amazement, they were immediately upon the earneſt purſuit and care of the ſupply of that want. When they found, we ſhall never be able to bear out with the Glory of the Wedding, immediately they ſay to the <hi>Wiſe, Give us of your Oil.</hi> But the <hi>Wiſe</hi> ſaid unto them, <hi>Not ſo, leſt there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that ſell, and buy for your ſelves.</hi> Go, and provide it; go, and take care for it. This is ſpoken only, to fill up the Parable; not that the thing could be ſo; but only to repreſent the thing as lively as might be. And <hi>while they went to buy,</hi> the <hi>Bridegroom came.</hi> And <hi>they that were ready, went in</hi> with him to <hi>the Marriage,</hi> and the <hi>Door was ſhut;</hi> preſently ſhut. That is, they went into the great Hall, to the great Room of Entertainment, to the Palace of the Bridegroom: They <hi>went in,</hi> that <hi>were ready;</hi> and the <hi>Door</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently <hi>ſhut.</hi> If any one was not ready; if they had not <hi>Oil in their Lamps,</hi> the <hi>Door</hi> was preſently <hi>ſhut.</hi> If they had not ſuch a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as would bear out that Entertainment, and went to provide, they were preſently <hi>ſhut</hi> out. And here,</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>laſt place,</hi> That is the great Uſe and Application that Chriſt makes of it: <hi>Watch therefore;</hi> for ye <hi>know neither the Day nor the Hour when the Son of Man cometh.</hi> Wherein our Saviour ſtill bears
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41902:6"/> out, according to the Nature of the Type, and to fill up all the Parts of it, and all the Colours of the Picture</p>
                     <p>For, the meaning is no more than this;</p>
                     <p>Look well to this, That you have a Proviſion, a Treaſure of Grace, that will laſt out the whole Time of the Wedding-Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: For, if you have not, you will not be able to make a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion then; you will be as thoſe that are unready.</p>
                     <p>Now, that this is the meaning of <hi>Watching,</hi> is very plain from hence; becauſe the Virgins that had Oil in their Lamps, and in their Veſſels too; they <hi>Slumbred</hi> and <hi>Slept,</hi> yet they went immediately into the <hi>Wedding.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But all thoſe that had only <hi>Oil</hi> in their <hi>Lamps,</hi> and not in their <hi>veſſels,</hi> they were ſhut out; there was no poſſibility of making Proviſion for themſelves at that time.</p>
                     <p>From all which particulars then, that I have given you at this Time but the Generals of, I collect,</p>
                     <p>Let it be our care, let us ſeriouſly look to it, that we make ſuch a proviſion now, that may laſt out that whole State; that is, That we have ſuch Grace, as will bear out the Tryal of that Day, and that Time.</p>
                     <p>That's the main Importance of this ſo great Parable, ſo excellent Parable; that every one of us ſhould look to it, That we have ſuch Treaſure, ſuch real Riches of Grace in the Blood of Jeſus, and in the power of his Death and Reſurrection upon us, that will comport with that great Solemnity of the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt. And let us not ſay among all the Profeſſions and Ways that there are in the VVorld, we have choſen out what we think the beſt, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt: It is not enough, that we are Virgins in our Profeſſion, but we muſt have this rich Treaſure, this real Treaſure of Grace in our Hearts. This, I ſay, is the main Importance of this great Parable, and it Iſſues into this, That we ſhould take heed of pleaſing our ſelves in a Profeſſion; and that we ſhould be under the power of this Apprehenſion, That the moſt excellent Profeſſion that there is in the World, in the whole Chriſtian Name, whatever it is that ſhall have the Precedency above any other; yet if our Hearts are not Enriched with the true Grace of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt, we do not know the Truth, as it is in Chriſt effectually. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore indeed, there is not any place of Scripture that Imports a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Severity, or makes more neceſſary tryal and ſearch into our State and Condition, than this very Parable does. For when it
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41902:7"/> gives a Repreſentation of the pureſt State that can be given; that is, to call all Virgins; and yet that ſome of theſe are ſhut out for ever, from the Glory of the Kingdom of Chriſt; How ſhould it (as our Saviour ſpeaks in a like Parable) engage us to <hi>ſtrive to enter in at the strait Gate?</hi> For <hi>many ſhall ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able. Many of the Children of the Kingdom ſhall be thruſt out;</hi> as Chriſt ſpeaks in another place. This is the great care therefore that ſhould lie upon us, to ſecure the inward part, the vital part, the true Power, the true Light of Chriſtianity, that ſhall never be as a Lamp put out in obſcure Darkneſs. If you look upon the 14 <hi>Revel.</hi> you may ſee what a high Importance this very Word, or Repreſentation of <hi>Virgins</hi> hath; ſaith the Spirit of God there, concerning thoſe that were in the purity of <hi>Chriſtian Religion;</hi> Theſe (ſaith he) are <hi>VIRGINS,</hi> and <hi>have not defiled themſelves with Women,</hi> as other Profeſſors of the Name of Chriſt had; with the Impurity that others were defiled with. For they are <hi>Virgins,</hi> and <hi>they follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goeth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that though this be ſo great a Repreſentation of the purity of Chriſtian Religion; yet you ſee here in this <hi>Parable,</hi> our Saviour hath taken this very Repreſentation to ſet forth the State, that yet ſhall miſcarry in the End, to Eternity. And ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, 2 Cor. 11. 2. I am Jealous over you with a godly Jealouſie; for I have eſpouſed you to one Husband, that I may preſent you as a chaſt Virgin to Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You ſee ſometimes, this Repreſentation, Metaphor, or Emblem of a Virgin is made uſe of, to ſpeak the higheſt and trueſt <hi>Purity.</hi> And yet, our Lord doth (as it were) abaſe and humble it here, in ſpeaking of the <hi>Fooliſh Virgins;</hi> that he might gain his main point and end: That is, to tell us, The moſt excellent <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> let it be what it will, it will not avail us, if there be not the truth and power of Chriſtianity in it.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall therefore, according to the particulars I have laid down to you, endeavour to open this great <hi>Point</hi> all along, by thoſe lively Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances, that our Lord hath given us in this <hi>Parable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the firſt place, I ſhall conſider the State of the Goſpel, as it is here called the <hi>Kingdom;</hi> in its ſetting out, from the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, 'till it attains that great <hi>Point of Glory,</hi> its manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the viſible Appearance of our Lord Jeſus: It is all the while, <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven. Then ſhall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:41902:7"/>
                     <p>So as I have Repreſented to you, from <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. Here's the whole State, or Time of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, and of all the courſe and motion it runs: It begins in the preaching of the Goſpel, and it ends in the Glory of it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. I look upon it to be a great Foundation of all that Diſcourſe, that I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to Inſtruct you by, concerning the Kingdom of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>But when the fulneſs of time was come, God ſent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the Law.</hi> The firſt Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Chriſt, it is called <hi>the Fulneſs of Time;</hi> that's the beginning point of it. And then, there's the <hi>Recapitulation,</hi> the gathering of all things again into Chriſt; and that is, as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Eph. 1. 10. In the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of Times, he will gather together in one, all things in Chriſt, both which are in Heaven, and which are in Earth, even in him.</hi> In the <hi>Fulneſs of Time,</hi> Chriſt came to bear the <hi>ſins of many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> In the <hi>fulneſs of Times,</hi> he <hi>gathers all into himſelf.</hi> So that the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> it hath its beginning in the firſt Appearance of Chriſt; and it hath its uttermoſt Glory in the <hi>gathering together in one all things into Chriſt.</hi> And then it is <hi>delivered up</hi> into the Kingdom of Eternity. We ſhould therefore apprehend our ſelves, even now under the preaching of the Goſpel, that we are under the motion of the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> here's the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it. And then we ſhould look to our ſelves, and draw All to the Iſſue, and laſt Reſult. For, the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> laſts till that great Solemnity of the <hi>Marriage-Supper of the Lamb;</hi> it laſts to that very time, and ſo it continues till the <hi>Kingdom is delivered up to God, all in all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You ſhall find as ſoon as ever Chriſt came to be Preached, and to be declared, immediately there is the uſe of this very Phraſe, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Mat. 3, 2. <hi>John the Baptiſt went out, and ſaid, Repent ye, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</hi> And ſo it is ſaid of Chriſt; that He alſo went forth to Preach in the very ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; <hi>Repent</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand,</hi> Mat. 4. 17. So that here is the whole State of the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> it begins at the Preaching of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and it goes on to the Perfection, and to the Glory of the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>Let us therefore obſerve what is the motion of the Goſpel upon our Hearts; becauſe it is the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> And we ſhould look to the Power, and to the mighty Influences that it hath upon our Souls in that very regard; becauſe that it is <hi>the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:41902:8"/> in its firſt beginnings, and in its firſt Preparations, till it comes into the Glory of it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall therefore Endeavour at this time, to Diſcourſe this Point to you, concerning this Power of the Goſpel, as it is <hi>the Kingdom;</hi> and Apply it, by way of ſtrong Reflection upon our own Hearts; And that we may conſider what our own State and Condition is, in relation to it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt therefore, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven</hi> is the offer of the Great Salvation of Jeſus Chriſt unto Souls; It is the Offer of that great State that ſhall be hereafter. There is a preſent Offer of it to us now. The Goſpel comes to this very purpoſe, to invite us, by the preſent Preaching, and by the outward Publication and Adminiſtration of it: It comes to Invite us to that great Kingdom, that is called, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> The Goſpel repreſents it ſelf now to us, with all the earneſtneſs, and Wooing-Language<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we may be drawn in unto Jeſus Chriſt. This is the firſt thing wherein it is called, and worthy to be called, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> becauſe it comes with the offer of Heaven, and with the offer of Life and Grace unto every Soul. Heaven is bowed down; <hi>God rends the Heavens,</hi> and comes down to us in the preaching of the Goſpel. It is called therefore, <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven taken from one, and given to another. The Kingdom of Heaven ſhall be taken from you, and given to a Nation bringing forth the fruits of it,</hi> Mat. 2. 43. Becauſe this Kingdom makes an offer of Life, and an offer of Grace to every Soul. It is that very thing that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, in 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 19. God was in Chriſt, reconciling the World unto himſelf; and not imputing to them their Treſpaſſes. Wherefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we are Ambaſſadors for Chriſt,</hi> (ver. 20.) <hi>as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſt's stead, be ye reconciled to God.</hi> God is pleaſed to make an offer to every one that hears of <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> He bows the Heaven (as I ſaid) down to you, and to you, and to every one of us that are under the preaching of his Goſpel. The Kingdom of Heaven ſtoops down, it condeſcends it ſelf to make a gracious Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to every one that hears it this Day. <hi>If any one will, let him come and take the water of life freely:</hi> As it is ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 17. If any one hath a Mind, and a Deſire to the Kingdom of Heaven, when it is thus offered. Chriſt therefore laid the Foundation of it in his own Coming.</p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:41902:8"/>
                     <p>He begins it by <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> that was <hi>to prepare his way,</hi> and he carried it on by himſelf. And ſtill, by one <hi>Series</hi> and Courſe of his Servants after another, he hath taken care, that in one part of the World, or other, ever ſince the Reſurrection of Chriſt, there hath been an offer of this <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> all along, to the Sons of Men, in the publick Preaching of the Goſpel. Indeed, I know, the Wiſdom, and Glory, and Soveraignty of God hath greatly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted it ſelf; in that there are many Nations at this very Day, that have not the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> Preached to them. And even amongſt our ſelves, what variety there is in the Diſpenſation of this <hi>Word of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Kingdom</hi> unto us? As our Saviour calls it, <hi>The Word of the Kingdom, Matth.</hi> 13. 19. When any one <hi>heareth the Word of the Kingdom.</hi> So that's the firſt Notion that Scripture gives us of the Kingdom of Heaven; it is in the offer of Life, and Grace, and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Jeſus Chriſt, in the publick Preaching of the Goſpel. Now thus indeed, Men may ſeem (as it were) at their choice, and at their Election, whether they will accept the Kingdom of Heaven, or not, whether any one will open their Ears, and hear.</p>
                     <p>How many ſay, If this be the Kingdom of Heaven; we do not at all deſire it? They turn their Backs upon it, and refuſe, ſlight, and contemn it; becauſe it is not with Majeſty enough (as they think) and it does not bring preſent Glory and Advantage enough.</p>
                     <p>It therefore tells us, It is not the preſent State, it is not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Condition. We are ready to ſay, What does it bring us? And where is the Power and Glory it brings along with it now?</p>
                     <p>This therefore now we are Taught, That the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is only now, by way of Doctrine; by way of Offer; by way of gracious Propoſal to the Souls of Men; it does not yet come in its Majeſty, Glory, and in its Power. But as I ſhall ſhew you, in the third Particular, The Kingdom of Heaven never reſts, till it comes in its Glory, and in its Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>This therefore is the firſt Expreſſion of it; the preaching of the Goſpel is the Kingdom of Heaven; the Sounding of Chriſt and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in your Ears, telling you of an Everlaſting State and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Happineſs, or Miſery, if you refuſe. This is <hi>the lifting up of many,</hi> as our Saviour ſpeaks, which is a very lively Conſideration upon the <hi>Point</hi> that I am now upon. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 20. He began to <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid the Cities, wherein his mighty Works had been done; becauſe they repented not. Wo unto thee Chorazin, wo unto thee Bethſaida; for if the mighty works which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41902:9"/> they would have repented long ago, in ſackcloth and aſhes. But I ſay unto you, It ſhall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the Day of Judgment, than for you. And thou Capernaum, which art exalted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, ſhalt be brought down to Hell; for if the mighty Works which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained until this day. But I ſay unto you, it ſhall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom, than for thee.</hi> Here you ſee, we have the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, and the offer of Chriſt; this is the Kingdom of Heaven bowing, and ſtooping to you; making an offer of it ſelf freely to you, and (as we ſay) courting the Acceptance of Souls: We ſhould look upon it as ſo: not for the worthineſs of thoſe that Speak, or for the Ability with which they ſpeak; but the Source of all is, this excellent Doctrine of the Goſpel, that we have in the Word of God. And indeed, If we had not a Tongue to ſpeak it, or Ears to hear it; yet to behold the mighty Government of God and Chriſt, the evil of Sin, and the excellency of Grace, and of the Spirit of God, and of the Salvation of Chriſt, throughout; it is to put you into Heaven, to introduce you into Heaven, even while you are here upon Earth. Do not think that it is a ſmall thing, that theſe excellent Promiſes, theſe excellent Doctrines, theſe excellent Exhortations and Counſels are Adminiſtred unto you: For, it is even Heaven upon Earth, this very Word of God; and, for the preaching of it, that is only a further Ordination of God; that every one may have it ſpoken unto them, and be perſuaded, <hi>In ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon;</hi> and that there might be a more forcible Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the Souls of Men. But if we have but the Word of God (this Scripture) lying in our Houſes, we have the Kingdom of Heaven (I may ſay) lying in our Houſes, in this Senſe I am now ſpeakjng of it to you: You have it, becauſe you have this excellent Doctrine of Chriſt: And there are Scriptures; there are many Scriptures, that are ſo exceeding clear and plain, that he may run that reads. No one that hath but this Book of God, either that he Reads, or, that is ordinarily read to him; but he may ſay, I am exalted herein to Heaven; becauſe I have ſuch an excellent Scripture, ſuch an excellent Goſpel continually before me.</p>
                     <p>So the very Sound of it, the very Motion of it in the World; it is the great Happineſs of thoſe parts of the World that have it. And we have great Reaſon to ſay, in this place, in this City, in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and eſpecially, wherever God lights up a clearer Taper and Torch of his Goſpel; we have Reaſon to ſay, That Heaven is come
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41902:9"/> down to us; and that we can go when we pleaſe, and Read one of the excellent Sermous and Diſcourſes of our Lord Jeſus in the Goſpel: That we can go to the Epiſtles, and read thoſe admirable Things that the Spirit of God hath given out by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, James,</hi> and <hi>John.</hi> Theſe things, you do not Apprehend the great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of them.</p>
                     <p>We talk of Heaven, and we would be glad to go to Heaven; and Heaven is the great Burden of all our wiſhes, and all our hopes. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven is here among us;</hi> the Truth of his Word lying open to us.</p>
                     <p>How dreadful therefore will even that Duſt that gathers upon our Bibles, from day to day be! I ſay what a Teſtimony will it be! And, as our Saviour ſaith to thoſe that he ſent out to Preach his Goſpel; <hi>It ſhall be more tolerable</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for Sodom and Gomorrah,</hi> than for thoſe that refuſe it. And the very <hi>dust of your feet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>when you depart out of that City, ſhake off, as a witneſs against them,</hi> Mat. 10. 14. So the very duſt of our Bibles will riſe up in Judgment againſt us; becauſe, when God hath opened the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of Heaven to us in it; we have refuſed, and ſcorned, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, and (to Speak in our ordinary Language) counted it as a Book out of date, becauſe we have had it ſo long. O! If you did but know what a value the Martyrs, in the Days of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> ſet upon it, when the Light was but juſt ſprung out; what a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue did they put upon the Scriptures! And indeed, if God were cutting us ſhort, and a <hi>Famine</hi> of his <hi>Word</hi> coming upon us; we ſhould then ſay, what a great Treaſure is God taking from us! And yet how many Hours do we paſs in the Day, and not read of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> that is ſo pourtrayed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in the Goſpel to us?</p>
                     <p>There is a Time that is ſet out to us by Prophecy; and there's great Reaſon to hope that it is very near, when this Kingdom of Heaven, in the <hi>Everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> ſhall Ride (as it were) Circuit, or rather, at one time be heard from the midſt of Heaven, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Earth, <hi>Rev. 14. 6. I ſaw an Angel fly through the midſt of Heaven, having the Everlaſting Goſpel to Preach unto them that dwell on the Earth, and to every Kindred, and Tongue, and People. This Everlaſting Goſpel of the Kingdom of Heaven, It ſhall be preached to every Nation, and Kindred, and Tongue, and People.</hi> Whereas now, in many parts of <hi>America;</hi> and whereas now, in the whole Plat of the Regions; where the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Power is, and where
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41902:10"/> 
                        <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is, There is a concealment of this Goſpel; a denial, a ſhutting of it up from the Acquaintance, and Knowledge, and Reading, and Hearing, of the generality of the People; it is here Preached in ſuch a way, as to make known the great Counſels and Myſteries of the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> to Men. But,</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Second Place:</hi> The <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> is in the mighty work and operation of the Goſpel of Chriſt upon our Hearts. Then, when we find Chriſt to be the <hi>Pearl of great Price,</hi> and <hi>ſell all to buy him;</hi> when we look upon him as the onely Treaſure, and the onely Riches; when our Hearts are under the beginnings of Grace, and the powerful Operations of it; then is the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> come to be <hi>within us,</hi> Matth. 13. 31. <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is like to a grain of Mustard-ſeed, which a Man took, and ſowed in his Field: which indeed is the leaſt of Seeds; but when it is grown, is the greateſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Herbs, and becometh a Tree; ſo that the Fowls of Heaven lodge in the Branches of it.</hi> This is an Expreſſion of the Preaching of the Goſpel; which, if it be received, and taken in, in the power of the Goſpel upon the Heart, It is indeed, a little thing, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; but it ſpreads more and more upon the Heart and Life. And, <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven</hi> (ver. 33.) <hi>is like unto Leaven, which a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man took, and hid in three meaſures of Meal, till the whole was leavened.</hi> This is the Preaching of the Goſpel, and alſo the power of it upon the Hearts of Men. And when it is a Seed that takes upon hearts, and brings forth abundantly Fruit to Eternal Life, that alſo is the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> And, <hi>ver. 44. The Kingdom of Heaven is like treaſure hid in a field, the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth, and ſelleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a Merchant Man, ſeeking goodly Pearls, who when he had found one Pearl of great price, he went and ſold all that he had, and bought it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> coming within a Man, giving him ſuch a value of Jeſus Chriſt, that he looks upon all things elſe, (as the Apoſtle ſaith) to be no better than <hi>droſs and dung,</hi> in compariſon of the <hi>Excellency of the Knowledge of Chriſt.</hi> You know the World, how Ambitious it is of the Riches of Pearl; how deſirous of the Glory, of the Luſtre and Splendour that it gives to them, that wear it? Now when a Man counts Chriſt a <hi>Pearl</hi> beyond all value, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all Eſteem. This is the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>within a Man.</hi> It is not <hi>in Word</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) but <hi>in Power. It is the Kingdom of God in Righteouſneſs, and Peace, and Joy
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41902:10"/> in the Holy Spirit. viz.</hi> The Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and that Joy, and Peace of Conſcience that ariſes from it, by the Spirit of God apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to our Hearts.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore, All the Time that we live here in the World, we ſhould be gathering our ſelves into this <hi>Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> and to have the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven within us.</hi> That is indeed the <hi>Oil in our Veſſels,</hi> when we have the very Spirit, and the very State of the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven within us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I know that we are now in a State of Imperfection, and cannot riſe up to the Glory of theſe Things, but yet in the Truth and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of it; every one that is fitted for the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> he hath this value of Chriſt within him, this inward, ſincere Love of Him, and Reſignation of his Heart to Him; though it be not come into the Glory: Though this <hi>Muſtard-ſeed</hi> hath not yet ſprung up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all its Amplitudes, and into all its Greatneſs. This therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend within your ſelves; <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven</hi> (as Chriſt ſpeaks) it does not <hi>come with obſervation,</hi> that Men ſhould ſay, <hi>Lo here,</hi> or <hi>lo there;</hi> but (ſaith he) <hi>The Kingdom of God is within you,</hi> Luke 17. 21. He was demanded, <hi>When the Kingdom of God ſhould come?</hi> (ver. 20.) And he anſwered, and ſaid, <hi>The Kingdom of God cometh not with obſervation; neither ſhall they ſay, Lo here, or lo there; for, behold, the Kingdom of God is within you;</hi> So I ſay, we ſhould look for Heaven within us. We can never go to Heaven (for that is but an Expreſſion in Compariſon) except Heaven come down now into our Hearts, and except we carry Heaven into Heaven, within our ſelves, within our Spirits. This (as I ſay) is that <hi>Oil within our Veſſels,</hi> that will keep up the State of Heaven in us, and to us; not by any vertue of its own; but as it is a Grace given, and a Light given from that Supream Light; from that <hi>Light</hi> (as the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaith) <hi>that lighteth every Man that cometh into the World.</hi> Let us not therefore ſay, Here, or there, is that Kingdom; but let us look what we have of it in our ſelves. That is the <hi>Lamp</hi> of Profeſſion only, when we ſpeak of a Kingdom without us. That is the <hi>Veſſel</hi> fill'd with <hi>Oil</hi> within; when we have this <hi>Kingdom with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us.</hi> The <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> as it is a meer Profeſſion, it is Separable from us; we may be parted from It, and It from us.</p>
                     <p>It ſhall <hi>be taken from you</hi> (as Chriſt ſaith) and <hi>given to a Nation bringing forth the Fruits thereof.</hi> So all the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> in the profeſſion of it, will be taken from them that have it, as <hi>the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> was taken from <hi>the unprofitable Servant. That which we have</hi> (as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41902:11"/> Chriſt ſpeaks) <hi>is taken from us.</hi> And therefore, if any of us ſay, O how ezcellent is it to hear, or to ſpeak of the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, or of the Kingdom of Heaven! It is our Great Delight. Then look to this, that you have it <hi>within you:</hi> For that <hi>Outward King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> though you delight in it never ſo much, it ſhall be <hi>taken from you:</hi> As, <hi>the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>d are theſe:</hi> And yet that Temple was taken from them. So it may be ſaid, <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven Are Theſe.</hi> But we muſt ſo hear, and ſo ſpeak, and ſo converſe, as having it within us; Elſe remember, the Kingdom will be taken from you; ſeparated from you for ever, and you caſt into that Kingdom of Darkneſs and Miſery to all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>
                     <p>3. The <hi>Third Expreſſion</hi> (with which I will ſhut up this Diſcourſe concerning <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven</hi>). You muſt not think, that the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> laſts onely while you are in the preſent <hi>State;</hi> But the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> will be even throughout that Glory of its Appearance: And it is not ſeen, nor known like it ſelf, till it be known in that <hi>Glory,</hi> and in the Separation which ſhall be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Wiſe,</hi> and the <hi>Fooliſh Virgins,</hi> and between thoſe that have had onely a Profeſſion, and thoſe who have had the Power: For, the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> hath its greateſt Work, Its greateſt Effect to ſhew yet upon every one of us: It never ceaſes to be a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> no not when it hath made this Separation between the one and the other; For then it takes into it thoſe that are its own; and will throw out of it ſelf thoſe that tho they ſeem to be of it for a Time; yea when all things come into enquiry, into that Great Re-ſearch; It ſhall be made known at that Day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they did not indeed pertain <hi>to the Kingdom,</hi> who had it not within: Obſerve <hi>Mat. 8. 12. The Children of the Kingdom ſhall be caſt out into utter Darkneſs.</hi> That is, they that have had this <hi>Kingdom</hi> in Perfection, but not the Power of it within them. So that I ſay, the great Manifeſtation <hi>of the Kingdom of Heaven</hi> is, when it comes to ſepparate between the one and the other, and to have its own for ever within it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Obſerve therefore, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. Our Saviour compares the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven</hi> to ſuch kind of things, that ſtill it may be known, that it is not a <hi>Kingdom</hi> in its Glory, till it comes to this Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of things. We find <hi>ver.</hi> 24. ſaith our Lord, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a Man that ſowed Seed into his Field; But while Men ſlept, the Enemy came and Sowed Tares among the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41902:11"/> Wheat, and went away.</hi> But when the <hi>blade was ſprung up, and brought forth fruit; then the tares appeared alſo. So the ſervant of the houſe-holder came and ſaid unto him, Sir, didſt not thou ſow good Seed in thy field? From whence then hath it tares? And he ſaid, An enemy hath done this. The ſervant ſaid unto him, wilt thou then that we go and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them up? But he ſaid nay, let both grow together till the time of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt; and in the time of harveſt, I will ſay to the Reapers, gather you to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether first the tares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.</hi> So you ſee here, that there is that great difference between the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> now, and the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> as it ſhall manifeſt it ſelf. It takes in <hi>Tares</hi> now, as well as <hi>Wheat.</hi> And ſo in the ſame manner, it is compared unto a <hi>Net,</hi> that drew in <hi>both good and bad into it ſelf.</hi> But then it came to that, <hi>that the good are ſeparated from the bad,</hi> and the <hi>bad are caſt into a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of fire,</hi> where there ſhall be <hi>weeping</hi> and <hi>wailing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now I may ſay to you (in ſome humble meaſure) as Chriſt ſaid to his Hearers; <hi>Have ye underſtood all theſe things? They ſay unto him, yea, Lord.</hi> So I ſay to you, Have you conſidered, and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in good meaſure underſtood what I have been now ſpeaking to you? That <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven</hi> ſets out in the Preaching of it; But where it is not the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven within us,</hi> we have only a <hi>Lamp</hi> of Profeſſion; And therefore, it will certainly come to <hi>that,</hi> That before the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> hath done, it will ſeparate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween one ſort of Men and the other. The <hi>Tares</hi> ſhall be <hi>gathered into bundles to be burnt;</hi> and the <hi>bad Fiſh,</hi> though they have come to the <hi>Net,</hi> and come within the <hi>Net,</hi> yet they ſhall be ſeparated, and caſt into the <hi>furnace of fire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the Kingdom of Heaven, and this is the ſame thing which our Saviour intends in this very Parable, I have Explained to you. The Kingdom of Heaven never ceaſes, till it hath ſeparated <hi>fooliſh and wiſe Virgins;</hi> And therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Then ſhall the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> Which is a great Key to this Parable, in this <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew. Then ſhall the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> When do you think our Lord meant? He meant, at that very Time that was ſpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Now you ſhall find in the 46 <hi>verſe,</hi> it is written, <hi>Bleſſed is that Servant, whom his Lord when be cometh, ſhal
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41902:12"/> find ſo doing. Verily I ſay unto you, that he ſhall make him ruler over all his goods. But, and if that evil Servant ſhall ſay in his heart. My Lord delayeth his coming, and ſhall begin to ſmite his fellow-ſervants, and to eat and drink with the drunken; the Lord of that Servant ſhall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour when he is not aware of; and ſhall cut him aſunder, and appoint him his Portion with the Hypocrites; there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> And then, at that very time, <hi>ſhall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto Ten Virgins;</hi> who have indeed their time all along in the ſeveral Generations of Men, ſince the Reſurrection of Chriſt; the Kingdom of Heaven hath been, and ſhall be in Motion (as I tell you) from the <hi>fulneſs of Time, till the fulneſs of all Times.</hi> And then, at the <hi>fulneſs of Times,</hi> it ſhall be likened unto <hi>Ten Virgins, Five Wiſe,</hi> and <hi>Five Fooliſh; Five taken into the Kingdom of Heaven</hi> for ever, and <hi>Five</hi> that are <hi>thruſt out.</hi> That is, whoever they are, that are found <hi>Fooliſh Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For, certainly, to make the Parable more capacious, and to ſpread it the wider, for the obſervation and conſideration of all, the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is made equal; not that they are ſo in themſelves; there are not equal <hi>Wiſe</hi> and equal <hi>Fooliſh:</hi> For, alas! the inequality is very great, in compariſon; the <hi>Fooliſh</hi> mightily exceed the <hi>Wiſe,</hi> in the preſent State of things.</p>
                     <p>Though I make no doubt, there will be a different State, when the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> opens it ſelf; there will be many, and many brought to Chriſt. So that I make doubt, whether the number of thoſe that ſhall be then brought into Chriſt, will not raiſe the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Saved, ſo as to exceed the other; but, I will let that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. But what I now tell you is, That the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> will not ceaſe till it hath made a Separation between one and the other: and ſo ſhine out in the midſt of them that are taken into it: And, I might give you many great Expreſſions to this purpoſe; but the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables in <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. are abundantly ſufficient to ſhew you, That till the <hi>Lord</hi> of the great <hi>Harveſt</hi> comes, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven</hi> will not ceaſe; and then there will be a Separation made of the one from the other.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall now ſhut up this great Doctrine, with Two cloſe Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>That we would (Firſt) receive this great Doctrine, this Thunder and Lightning, into out Conſciences and Affections.</hi>

                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:41902:12"/>
                     <p>What! hath our Lord ſaid. That even thoſe that are <hi>Virgins</hi> may be counted <hi>Fooliſh?</hi> even thoſe that may be counted of the higheſt and pureſt Churches may be <hi>Fooliſh Virgins?</hi> The <hi>Door</hi> may be <hi>ſhut</hi> upon them? They may have <hi>Oil in their Lamps</hi> only in this World, but not able to bear up in this <hi>Marriage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Supper of the Lamb,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in every one is to have his peculiar <hi>Lamp</hi> and <hi>Oil,</hi> to feed and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh an exceeding Light and Flame of Purity, of Holineſs. May <hi>Virgins</hi> have no <hi>Oil</hi> to ſupply at that time?</p>
                     <p>Oh then! with what ſerious Caution, Fear and Trembling, ſhould I look back upon my ſelf, and obſerve, whether my Profeſſion hath the inward Riches, the intrinſick Value and Worth in it, or not? Whether there be <hi>Oil</hi> in my <hi>Veſſel,</hi> as well as in my <hi>Lamp?</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have ſuch a Holineſs, as will bear out in that Glorious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Chriſt, and of his Angels, and of all his Saints with Him? Shall I not be put upon it in that Day, to run a begging, (as it were) for the <hi>Oil</hi> in my <hi>veſſel?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Have we not Eaten and Drank, may we ſay, together at the Table of Chriſt? Have we not made Profeſſion of Chriſt and the Goſpel? Muſt we now be Separated from the real Saints and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God? Have I only had that which would ſerve me to hear, and pray with in publick, and to receive the Lord's Supper? Have I only had that which is the Profeſſion of the Reformed and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, and not the Power? And muſt I now be turned out from it, and take my Habitation amongſt the fouleſt <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> Idolaters, and the worſt of thoſe <hi>Superſtitioniſts?</hi> Nay, muſt I be turned out among the Heathen, among thoſe that have been the profeſt Enemies of God, and Jeſus Chriſt, and in a worſe caſe than they?</p>
                     <p>Theſe things, it is our Faithfulneſs, and love to our ſelves, and to our own Souls, to declare them to our ſelves, and to meditate upon them; and to ſearch with great conſideration into our ſelves, to know whether <hi>Chriſt be in us of a Truth?</hi> or whether we have the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> indeed within us? whether we are not run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning up and down with Obſervation, as Chriſt ſaid, to ſay, where is the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven?</hi> Where is the true Light of the Goſpel? Where is the beſt Profeſſion, and the beſt Adminiſtration of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances? And in the mean time, that I do not look for the Truth of Faith, the Truth of Repentance, the Spirituality of Knowledge, the power of Holineſs upon my own Heart, and upon my own Life. O that every one of us might make this uſe of it, to turn that Light
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41902:13"/> of Profeſſion Inward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſearch our own Hearts (as it were) with a Lamp lighting inwards, and with Candles, that we may know how it is with our own Souls. And then,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Let us look earneſtly forward to that Appearance, to that Kingdom of Heaven, which our Lord hath here preſented to us; It is to come to another Being, to another Repreſentation than is now. We ſee things now, but in a very dim and a dark Light: As I have often told you, we are in the foul, and in the dark place of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy</hi> yet. The Time is near at hand, when every thing ſhall be ſeen in its full Light, and in its glorious Appearance and Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                     <p>And then, Though it is a Day of Terrour to all wicked, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, and diſſolute Perſons, under general Profeſſion of Chriſtianity. And though it be a terrible Day alſo to Virgins that have Oil in their Veſſels; that is, who make a great deal of their Profeſſion, and have no Truth of Grace; it will be terrible to them, when they come to find themſelves ſo ſadly benighted and darkened, in the very Heaven of their Profeſſion; as the Expreſſion is in the Prophet; Their very <hi>Lamp</hi> goes out in <hi>obſcure darkneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet it is a Day of Rejoycing, and a Day of Glory in it ſelf. And what great Reaſon have we earneſtly to pray, every one for our ſelves, and for them that are in ſuch a dark and hopeleſs condition, that they have not ſo much as Lamps; even thoſe that are under the <hi>Profeſſion of Chriſtianity,</hi> and yet are in ſuch a caſe; Now, I ſay, in regard to the hopeleſs ſtate of all thoſe; and that we, who have a clearer Light of the Goſpel breaking out, may have more of the power; We have Reaſon to pray for the Approach of that Time, when the <hi>Kingdoms of this World,</hi> ſhall be Proclaimed <hi>to be the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt;</hi> When <hi>the Spirit ſhall be poured out upon us from on high;</hi> and <hi>the Everlasting Goſpel ſhall be preached to every Nation, and Tongue, and People under Heaven.</hi> O! that our Hearts were earneſt for this Time, and this State; and that our Souls would <hi>give God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

                     </head>
                     <p>I Have begun to lay, before you the great Importance of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and Reduced it to this Propoſition, as a Foundation of Diſcourſe on the Particulars;</p>
                     <p>That even the Pureſt, and moſt <hi>Virgin-Profeſſion of Chriſtianity,</hi> ſhould look well to it ſelf, and take great care, that it does not truſt even in the beſt of Appearance of Things; I ſay, in the very beſt of Appearances; but that it ſhould look to the inward Treaſure, and the intrinſick value of Chriſtianity in the Heart.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe here the <hi>Fooliſh Virgins</hi> were pleaſed with the <hi>Lamp of Profeſſion,</hi> without the Treaſure of <hi>Oil in the Veſſel;</hi> and when it came to the great Up-ſhot and Reſult, their <hi>Lamps</hi> quickly went out; they failed, even in the very time; and ſo they were for ever ſhut out from the Glory, and the Joy, and the Happineſs of the Solemnity of the Wedding.</p>
                     <p>Having laid out this Point in the Particulars of the Parable; I came to the firſt Particular, and that was to tell you, <hi>That the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is throughout, from firſt to laſt, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> whether you conſider it in the Preaching of the Goſpel, it is the opening of Heaven, and of the great Counſels of the Eternal Wiſdom of God in the Heavens; Or, whether you conſider it, as it comes into the Heart of every particular Chriſtian; ſo it is the power of Heaven, enabling them to ſet ſuch a value upon Jeſus Chriſt, that all the Things of the World are of no Account, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the <hi>Pearl of Great Price<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> Or, whether you conſider it in the laſt Glorious Appearance of this Kingdom, ſo it is Heaven; It is not a State that doth ſo much as pretend to any Senſual Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to any worldly Satisfaction; to any of the Grandeur of this World, or the Delights of it; but it is perfect Heaven; it is Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven throughout. This I have ſpoken of, and ſo I ſhall not add any Thing to it.</p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:41902:14"/>
                     <p>I come to a Second Particular in This General; and that is, to let you know, from the Repreſentation our Saviour hath here given; That the very Intent of Chriſtianity, the Great Deſign and Purport of it is this; It is a Preparation to the Enjoyment of Jeſus Chriſt; as the Great <hi>Bridegroom</hi> of our Souls, and as the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> of his Church. For ſo it is ſaid here, Theſe <hi>Virgins They took their Lamps;</hi> That is, As ſoon as ever they began to make a Profeſſion of Chriſt, and a Profeſſion of Chriſtianity; Immediately, in that very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they had an Eye to the <hi>Bridegroom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that this is the Great Purport of Chriſtianity, That we ſhould have a Spiritual Marriage-Union with Jeſus Chriſt; and in Order to the Enjoyment of him, in the Glory of his Kingdom, as the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> of our Souls. It is a very Great Emphaſis and Weight that the Spirit of God has put upon this Reſemblance, or Similitude of the Marriage Union between Chriſt and the Soul, and between Chriſt and his Church.</p>
                     <p>And if I ſhould be any thing able to declare and to open it to you at this Time, in the Spirituality of it, and thereby ſolicit, and draw the Affections of every one of us to Jeſus Chriſt; I ſhould in ſome meaſure Anſwer that which <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> Repreſents, <hi>John 3. 29. He that hath the Bride is the Bridegroom: but the Friend of the Bridegroom, which ſtandeth and heareth him, rejoyceth greatly becauſe of the Bridegroom's Voice. This my Joy therefore is fullfilled.</hi> That is, There is no one, Preaching the Goſpel, who ought to draw the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Souls and of Spirits unto himſelf, but he is to look only to the Great <hi>Bridegroom;</hi> None of the <hi>Friends</hi> of the <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> That is, The Preachers of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, They are not to draw the Hearts of Men to themſelves. For what are they, as the Apoſtle ſaith (if they are the moſt Excellent) but <hi>Miniſters, by whom ye have believed?</hi> But, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We preach Chriſt Jeſus the Lord;</hi> and <hi>our ſelves your Servants for Chriſt's ſake:</hi> We preach Chriſt the <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> and our ſelves only the <hi>Friends of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom.</hi> And therefore every one ſhould take heed, that there be no Centring in himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (that ſpeaks of Chriſt) but onely in Chriſt Himſelf. And ſo every one of us ſhould take heed, that we do not Reſt and Centre in an Ordinance, or in a Diſcourſe of Chriſt; but that our Hearts go up to Chriſt Himſelf. For <hi>he that hath the Bride is the Bridegroom:</hi> And <hi>the Friend of the Bridegroom rejoyceth when he hears the voice of the Bridegroom.</hi> That is, when he finds that he ſpeaks to any Heart, and draws any Soul to him. How Happy
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41902:14"/> would it be, if in this Diſcourſe <hi>the voice of the Bridegroom might be heard,</hi> and diſcovered in any of our Hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that it might be known, that this Preaching of Chriſt hath prevail'd at all, upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Soul! This is to Rejoice in <hi>hearing the voice of the Bridegroom.</hi> O therefore that <hi>this Joy might be fullfilled</hi> in you that hear, and in me that am ſpeaking to you! But as he goes on) <hi>he muſt encreaſe, and I muſt decreaſe.</hi> That is, In all wherein we may ſeem to be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Chriſt, or ſerviceable to the Souls of Men, that muſt go off: And then the Kingdom and Glory of Chriſt Himſelf, that is It that muſt encreaſe. And therefore for thoſe that hear, and thoſe that ſpeak, to meet one another in that Great Solemnity, and in that Great Glory; and to find that all is gone off, but only Chriſt; How Gloſious and how Bleſſed will this State be!</p>
                     <p>I ſhall therefore endeavour to open this Great Point<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure unto you: Though I know it is not poſſible to ſpeak of it as it is to be ſpoken of. But I ſhall therefore,</p>

                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Lay down this, as a Great Scripture-Point, as a Great Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Truth;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That there is ſuch a</hi> Marriage-Union <hi>betwixt Chriſt and his Church, and betwixt Chriſt and every particular Soul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the ſecond place, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew you, wherein it ſtands at the preſent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> In the Opening of it, I ſhall ſhew you, That there is a State of it Now. And then.</p>
                     <p>That there is to be the Glory, and the Heighth of this State in the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt. Therefore I ſhall endeavour to ſhew you, wherein it ſtands now. And then,</p>
                     <p>In the third place, How the Glory of it ſhall break out; and in what Expreſſions the Scripture hath aſſured that to us: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that every one of us ſhould look upon our Profeſſion, as a Fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and a Preparation to that Great Solemnity of the <hi>Marriage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lamb.</hi>

All this, it is but Metaphor, Repreſenting Chriſt, as <hi>Drawing</hi> with the <hi>Savour of his Good Ointments:</hi> As Perſons make themſelves Acceptable by thoſe things that draw and win upon the Senſe, and ſo upon the Senſe of Smelling. This Savour of his Good Oyntment draws Souls to Chriſt. That is, thoſe Rich, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Excellencies in Him, win upon the Souls of thoſe that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed truly his, that are indeed <hi>Virgins;</hi> They draw the Love of Souls after Chriſt: The Pardon of Sin; His Righteouſneſs; His Reſurrection in the Power of it; His Death in the Power of it: His Life in the Power of it; The Glory of His Kingdom: Theſe Draw Souls. <hi>Draw me, we will run after thee.</hi> And the <hi>upright love thee.</hi> All that have Sincerity in the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, they truely love him.</p>
                     <p>And thus there is a Thread drawn throughout that whole Book, till it comes to the very Glory of the Kingdom of Chriſt. The laſt Words ſignifie it; <hi>Make haſte, my beloved, and be thou like a Roe, or to a Young Hart upon the Mountains of Spices.</hi> That is; The State of the Kingdom of Chriſt is juſt like a Mount of the moſt Aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, of the Sweeteſt Perfumes of Glory and Happineſs. This is the firſt Scripture that lays this great Point down before us: And there are many Expreſſions, eſpecially in that Evangelical Prophet, the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> comparing the Union betwixt Chriſt and his Servants to a Marriage; and to a Marriage that ſhall be ſolemnized, at laſt, in Glory.</p>
                     <p>But the ſecond Scripture that I would give you concerning it, is <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. Where the Apoſtle does draw, or delineate this very whole Repreſentation before us, in the Beginning, and in the Perfection of it: And indeed, he introduces the very firſt Inſtitution and Appointment of Marriage, to bring it all to this; That there was in it a much more Glorious Purpoſe, to prepare for, and to Repreſent the Union betwixt Chriſt and his Church. In ſpeaking therefore of the Duty of Husbands to their Wives, he enters into this Great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: ſaith he, <hi>The Husband is the Head of the Wife,</hi> even as <hi>Chriſt is the Head of the Church;</hi> and <hi>he is the Saviour of the Body. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the Church is ſubject unto Chriſt,</hi> ſo let the <hi>Wives be to their own Husbands</hi> in every thing: And Chriſt, as an Husband (<hi>ver.</hi> 25.) He <hi>loved the Church,</hi> and <hi>gave himſelf for it; That he might ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41902:15"/> and cleanſe it with the waſhing of water by the Word, That he might preſent it to himſelf a Glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing;</hi> but that <hi>it ſhould be holy and without blemiſh.</hi> For indeed, (as I ſhall preſently ſhew you, out of a Great Type of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in this Thing) Chriſt takes thoſe, whom he muſt Beautifie: He takes thoſe whom he muſt every way fit for ſo great an Enjoyment as that of Himſelf: He takes them out of Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, out of Impurity and Defilement, in a Miſerable, and Loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and Captivated State and Condition: But he never leaves till he brings it to this; That he <hi>may preſent them to Himſelf;</hi> That he may take them to Himſelf, without <hi>ſpot or wrinkle,</hi> or <hi>any ſuch thing.</hi> And then (ſaith he) <hi>for this Cauſe a Man ſhall leave his Father and Mother, and ſhall be Joyned to his Wife; and they ſhall be one fleſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is a <hi>Great Myſtery. But I ſpeak concerning Chriſt and the Church.</hi> That is, Here lies the Myſtery, the Great Point that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to preſent to you; that cloſe Union that is betwixt Chriſt and his Saints. And it comes (as I told you) to that Gloty, that He <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it to Himſelf a Glorious Church, without ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if you would know when this is; It is at the time of the Kingdom of Chriſt; at the time when he hath deſtroyed Falſe Chriſtianity; that Chriſtianity that is called in the Profeſſors, and Profeſſion of it <hi>The Whore.</hi> When that is quite taken away; that is, when all Falſe Chriſtianity ſhall be driven out of the World, and forced out, by the Power, and by the Glory of Chriſt; Then ſhall be this Glorious Solemnity of the Marriage of Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 1, 2. And ſo on in the Chapter.</p>
                     <p>And after theſe things <hi>I heard a great voice of much people in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſaying, Allelujah; Salvation, and Glory, and Honour, and Power unto the Lordour God: For true and righteous are his Judgments; for he hath judged the Great Whore?</hi> What is the <hi>Great Whore,</hi> but only Falſe Chriſtianity, called, <hi>Babylon the Great,</hi> that hath defiled the Doctrine, and defiled the Worſhip, and defiled the Holineſs of Converſation, and defiled the Spirituality of the Enjoyment of Chriſt. That's the meaning of the <hi>Great Whore.</hi> When therefore you ſee Chriſtianity is All Spirit, is All Heaven, is All Life, is All Purity, and Truth, and Glory, and <hi>Babylon</hi> deſtroyed; when you ſee that, then Immediately ſhall the <hi>Marriage-Supper of the Lamb</hi> follow: As you ſhall find in the 7th Verſe: <hi>Let us be glad and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, and give honour to him: for the Marriage of the Lamb is come,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41902:16"/> and his Wife hath made her ſelf ready. And to her was granted, that ſhe ſhould be arrayed in fine Linnen, clean and white: For the fine Linnen is the Righteouſneſs of Saints. And he ſaith unto me, Write, Bleſſed are they which are called unto the Marriage Supper of the Lamb. And he ſaith unto me, Theſe are the true Sayings of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That you may not ſay as the World is ready to do; even the Sober World, even that which is the Profeſſing World of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are ready to ſay, theſe things are nothing, but Whimſie, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Fancy, it is ſaid, <hi>Theſe are the true ſayings of God.</hi> To ſhew us, that the things ſhall certainly, and muſt needs come to paſs: And it ſhall be, when <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> ſhall be no longer in Form, and it ſhall be no longer in Rites and Ceremonies; when it ſhall be no longer in Humane Inſtitutions, and Commands; and it ſhall be no longer in the ſhining Grandeur of the World.</p>
                     <p>For, Men cannot ſee the <hi>Glory of Chriſtianity,</hi> becauſe they ſee ſuch a Gliſter of this World: But all this muſt go off, and what is Glorious indeed muſt come in its place; It ſhall be all Spiritual, Pure, and Divine.</p>
                     <p>And, If any of us can Love ſuch a <hi>Jeſus,</hi> if we have ſuch upright Hearts, and are drawn with the <hi>Savour of His Good Oyntments,</hi> and ſuch a <hi>Name</hi> as His, be to us, as <hi>Oyntment poured forth;</hi> It is certain, our State is Good, we are of thoſe upright, that do indeed Love Chriſt. But, If we ſay, Here's nothing of the Bravery of this World; Here's nothing of the Wit, and of the Paſs-time and of the Gaudery, and of the Retinue, and what the World is ſo pleaſed with, and meeting together to talk of nothing, that ſignifies any thing, but ſhrivells into meer Emptineſs, and into perfect Vanity, and Froth: I ſay, except we have theſe things, we don't know what to make of this <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and of this <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> VVhy then, we are but <hi>Fooliſh Virgins,</hi> that while we pretend; we have nothing but a <hi>Lamp,</hi> and our <hi>Lamp,</hi> at the proper time for its ſhining in Glory will go out.</p>
                     <p>And, ſo ſuitably and agreeably to this (you may ſee, and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you may take notice of it, how <hi>Scriptures</hi> do agree, and Breath the very ſame thing) The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelation</hi> ſpeaks as <hi>Solomon,</hi> who lived many Hundred Years before <hi>John;</hi> yet they both came into the very ſame Spirit, and into the very ſame Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For, you ſee, that which <hi>Solomon</hi> Celebrates under a <hi>Song of Marriage,</hi> a <hi>Song of Love;</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> does in the very ſame manner, Repreſent. I ſaw (ſaith he) <hi>The New Jeruſalem
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41902:16"/> come down,</hi> That is, the State of Saints, in this High, and Pure, and perfect Enjoyment of Chriſt. <hi>I ſaw it come down</hi> as a <hi>Bride adorned for her Husband.</hi> Chap. 22. 2. <hi>I ſaw the Holy City, New Jeruſalem.</hi> Which is nothing, but the Pure, and Holy, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and Happy State of Saints. <hi>I ſaw it coming down from God out of Heaven,</hi> as a <hi>Bride adorned for her Husband.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now, the earneſtneſs of all our deſires ſhould be after it. As it is ſaid, (ver. 17.) <hi>The Spirit and the Bride ſay, Come; And let him that heareth, ſay, Come.</hi> That is, let them who hear ſay ſo; as ſtruck with a <hi>Symphony,</hi> even as one Lute Anſwers another, the Lute upon the Wall, Anſwers that is ſtruck, and Tuned, and Play'd upon: So every Soul Tuned aright by Grace doth ſound alike, with the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>with the Bride,</hi> when he does but hear it ſay <hi>Come;</hi> It immediately ſaith, <hi>Come.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus I have ſhew'd you, that this Alluſion, Repreſentation, and Figure, is a Figure Repreſenting this great thing; Jeſus Chriſt is the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> of the Church, and every Particular Soul the <hi>Bride,</hi> or <hi>Lambs Wife;</hi> For, it is a wild ſort of Notion, that ſome people have of a Church: Who by it Principally mean a kind of Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and Authority, and Power, and a ſort and ſett of Men who ſhould enjoy it; They mean this by the Church they ſpeak ſo much of; Whereas the Spirit of God means by the Church chiefly Real Chriſtians, ſound, ſincere-hearted Profeſſors of Jeſus Chriſt, and Lovers of him; <hi>The upright Love thee;</hi> This is the meaning of a Church by Chriſt, and not a kind of Authority and Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that looks more like a Train, and a Court of this World, than any thing of the Power of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and the Power of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall therefore come, in proceeding in this Diſcourſe, to open to you theſe two things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there is a State of this Marriage-Relation to Chriſt; underſtand every thing (as I hope you do) ſpiritually and of the Power of Holineſs in our Hearts, and of the free Communication of the Righteouſneſs, and Grace, and Spirit of Chriſt, Till all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in Glory; underſtanding it thus, (I ſay) There are two great Spaces, Two Great States of it, one that is Here; and then the other, that ſhall be in the Glory of the <hi>Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And it hath pleaſed God to take great care, that both theſe ſhould be Repreſented to us.</p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:41902:17"/>
                     <p>Firſt of all, the <hi>State of the Soul here;</hi> It is like an <hi>Eſpouſal,</hi> it is like a <hi>Betrothing,</hi> it is like that, that we call among us, a Contract of Marriage: And according to Scripture, there is a diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it, and the Solemnity, and Compleating and Conſummation of the Marriage. And this is very neceſſary for us to conſider, that now is the time of preparing, and fitting Souls for that Great Solemnity; And therefore we read of a <hi>Virgin Betrothed</hi> to an Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, before the Solemnity of the Marriage; upon which Account, to the <hi>Jews</hi> it was appointed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> that there ſhould be at leaſt, Thirty days between the one and the other; And they looked upon it, as a Breach, and an Infraction upon the <hi>Moſaick-Law,</hi> If there was not ſuch a Time of Preparation; And ſome very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious Miniſters of the Goſpel have been of the Judgment, that there ought to be ſuch a kind of Preparation; And that it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Law of God, for the Wiſdom and Decency of ſuch a Solemnity as Marriage; I ſhall not inſiſt upon that. But it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry clear, that ſuch a thing was in uſe among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that the Law hath very great regard and reſpect to ſuch a thing, and that the Scripture is drawn out in ſuch a manner of Expreſſion.</p>
                     <p>Now, It is nothing to ſpeak of the Figure, that's not at all to my purpoſe; But to let you know, that there is a Time of <hi>Eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals</hi> of Sculs to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>According to this, and to Ground the Alluſion to you upon it; we find, <hi>Matth. 1. 18. The Birth of Jeſus Chriſt was on this wiſe; When as his Mother, Mary</hi> was <hi>Eſpouſed</hi> to <hi>Joſeph, before they came together:</hi> Before they came to dwell together, and to have the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Solemnized, while ſhe was his Spouſe; and ſo the Goſpel Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry goes on; So I ſay, there is an <hi>Eſpouſal</hi> of Souls to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and that is in the preſent State, in the preſent State wherein we are under the Preaching of the Goſpel; wherein we are under the motions of the Spirit of Chriſt; Here Chriſt begins, and he <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies</hi> and <hi>Cleanſes</hi> by the <hi>Waſhing of Regeneration,</hi> and by <hi>his Word,</hi> that he may <hi>preſent every Soul:</hi> There's the method of it, It begins here in a preparation; And therefore we ſhould conſider, whether we are under this preparation now for Jeſus Chriſt; Whether our affections are drawn to him; Whether we hear the Voice of the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> ſpeaking to us; Whether we have found the <hi>Savour of the Good Oyntments of Chriſt,</hi> and that it is not a <hi>Savour of Death,</hi> As the Apoſtle ſpeaks, in that great Scripture 2 <hi>Cor. 2. 14. Now Thanks be unto God, which always cauſeth us to triumph in Christ,</hi> and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41902:17"/> 
                        <hi>maketh manifeſt the Savour of his knowledge by us in every place.</hi> The Savour <hi>Oſme,</hi> that is the rich Perfume in every place, as in <hi>Solomons</hi> Song: ſaith he, <hi>Becauſe of the Savour of the good Oyntments, The Virgins Love thee. And, draw me, and we will run after thee; Thy Name is Oyntment poured forth:</hi> Now the Apoſtle ſpeaks juſt, as if he had taken his words out of that of <hi>Solomons Song;</hi> Saith he, <hi>Who maketh manifeſt the Savour,</hi> or Perfume, the Odour, or perfume of the Knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt. For (ſaith he) <hi>We are unto God a ſweet Savour of Chriſt,</hi> in them that are <hi>ſaved,</hi> and in <hi>them that periſh;</hi> That is, whether Men are taken, and drawn, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by this Savour, Odour, or Rich Perfume, or not, it is all one. Suppoſe the Perfume does not go down into our Hearts, and into our Thoughts and Affections, yet it ariſes up to Heaven, and there it is accepted; If there be none of you, that hear, or, I that ſpeak at this Time (Which I hope is far different) who find the Savour, and Excellency and Perfume of Chriſt, and of his Doctrine, and of the Knowledge of him; yet ſtill this <hi>Savour,</hi> this <hi>Odour</hi> riſes up to Heaven, and God is pleaſed with the Savour, tho we find nothing at all in it: But, ſaith he, we are to ſome a <hi>Savour,</hi> or <hi>Odour</hi> of <hi>Death unto Death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> That is, if a Man ſaith, I find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that you can ſay, offering the ſtrong ſcent, and Knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt; I do not find the Attractive, and VVinning Virtues and Powers of it; They do not at all prevail upon me: This is certainly unto Death; A Savour of Death, without Life, and unto Death: As it is ſaid of natural Odours and Scents, that they wrap, and twiſt themſelves about the Brain, and win upon the ſenſitive Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a Man, and ſo they draw, and pleaſe, and allure. In the very ſame manner, the Knowledge of Chriſt; VVhen we hear of a Crucified Saviour, who dyed for our Sins, and to bring us out of this Miſery and Ruine, it gives us the Savour, it wraps it ſelf, and Twiſts, and Twines it ſelf about our Minds, our Hearts, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and we cannot ſtir away from it, becauſe it is ſo excellent, ſo deſirable; Heres a <hi>Savour of Life;</hi> here's a quick, and a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful <hi>Savour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now, on the other ſide, when Men find not, when they feel not any ſuch thing; They ſay, this is a Dead Root; It hath not the proper ſcent of ſuch a Root; and it is not ſuch a Rich and an Admirable Oyntment, as you ſpeak of; we find nothing at all in it. If we ſpeak of Eating, and Drinking, and Buying, and Selling, and Riding out, and Enjoying and taking Pleaſure, and having
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41902:18"/> great Entertainments of Company; this we underſtand; But to ſay, Get into Chriſt; mind Him; get the Aſſurance of the Love of God in Him; Pardon of Sin in Him: We find nothing in this: It is a Dead Savour; Why then (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>It is to Death:</hi> It argues all is <hi>to Death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or, in another compariſon, if we ſhould bring (as Phyſitians ſay) a ſtrong Suffumigation to the Noſtrils of a Perſon that is in a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſtate (as the way is, to bring ſtrong Scents juſt under their Noſtrills; thoſe that are proper to ſtir up the Brain): and no Effect follows; This is to Death; The man is a Dead man. So when Chriſt is brought, and the Doctrine of his Salvation, to a Soul; and there is nothing at all of Worth, Effect or Efficacy, This Death is unto Death; Juſt as ſuch a kind of Suffumigation brought to a Dying Perſon, and no Effect, argues, That he'll die preſently, if the ſtrongeſt Savours and Perfumes have no Effect, and the Brain is juſt ready to be laid aſleep in Death.</p>
                     <p>So Conſcience, and Inward Senſe, which God hath planted in a man, in order to Spiritual Life, if they ſtir not at the Savour of Chriſt, it argues a perſon left of God, and he is under the Doom and Sentence of Death: If our <hi>Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them who are loſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Further, To Repreſent the main Point we are upon, to you, to ſhew you in what a State we are now, give me leave to make uſe of a Type, in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in this Thing; becauſe it doth great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Repreſent it; and I make no doubt, it was intended to this very purpoſe that I am now ſpeaking of. It is ſaid, <hi>Deut. 21. 10. When thou goeſt forth to war againſt thine Enemies.</hi> (I deſire you to take notice, that I ſpeak only of it, by way of Alluſion, and as a Type of this Thing). <hi>When thou goeſt forth to war againſt thine Enemies, and the Lord thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou haſt taken them captive; and thou ſeeſt among the captives a beautiful wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and haſt a deſire unto her, that thou wouldeſt have her to thy Wife: Then ſhalt thou bring her home unto thine houſe, and ſhe ſhall ſhave her Head, and pare her Nails; And ſhe ſhall put off the Raiment of her Captivity from off her, and ſhall remain in thine houſe, and bewail her father and her mother a full month,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>From which it may appear, (as I told you before) That God did ordain, and appoint under the Law, That there ſhould be Thirty Days between the Contract of Eſpouſals, and the Marriage. Such Time there was at leaſt to be, and eſpecially in the caſe of a <hi>Captive.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:41902:18"/>
                     <p>But here is the Thing that I intend:</p>
                     <p>We are all <hi>Captives,</hi> in a loſt, and in an undone condition, in a ruined ſtate; And therefore, if Chriſt hath a deſire to any of our Souls, in Grace, and Mercy, and Pity, and Compaſſion; there paſſes ſuch a kind of Preparation, ſuch a kind of fitting of us, for ſuch an Union to Jeſus Chriſt; There is a <hi>Shaving of the Head,</hi> and a <hi>Paring of the Nails;</hi> That is, the taking away of the Innate Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity of Luſt by Regeneration, the changing of the unholy, and unſpiritual, and unheavenly Temper of Heart and Mind, by Regeneration flowing from the Blood of Chriſt; That it may be brought into a nearneſs, and ſuitableneſs to Enjoy Chriſt: And there is the appointment of a Month, there is an appointment of Time of Preparation, wherein the Souls of his <hi>Servants</hi> are daily waſh'd in his Blood, and in the <hi>Chrystal Sea</hi> before the <hi>Throne;</hi> They generally walk with him, and find a Suitableneſs, and an Agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs between Chriſt, and them; till they come to ſay, they would never be ſeparated any more from him. They deſire to be joyned to him in an <hi>Everlaſting Covenant</hi> (as it is ſaid in the Prophet <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>) that ſhould <hi>never be forgotten;</hi> They deſire to forget all that, that they were uſed to, and united to before; and to be given up wholly and entirely to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Now, as it was under the Law; If any Woman being Eſpouſed to a Husband, did violate the Covenant of the Eſpouſals, and the Contract of the Eſpouſals; They were to dye for it. The Woman and the Man, that did ſo violate the Covenant of the Eſpouſals; Both the Man and the VVoman were to dye, according to the Law of God, by <hi>Moſes;</hi> even as if the Eſpouſals had been fully, and compleatly conſummated, by Marriage; There was no Difference in that Caſe between the one and the other.</p>
                     <p>So I ſay, if now, in the Time of our Eſpouſals, when we are under a Profeſſion of Chriſt, under a Profeſſion of his Name, his Goſpel, and Salvation by him, if our Hearts be not true, and entire to him, and given up wholly to him; Our Condemnation will be as Great, nay, it will be greater, than of the Heathen, than thoſe of the unbelieving VVorld, of thoſe that deny Chriſt; of thoſe that we call <hi>Anti-Chriſtians,</hi> or Profeſſors at large; It will be greater Condemnation, becauſe we violate the Love of our Eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals.</p>
                     <p>Here's the great VViſdom of God, in Repreſenting this thing to us; that we may know how to behave our ſelves, and give up our
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41902:19"/> ſelves, to Chriſt, and to devote our ſelves to him, in this State of our Eſpouſals.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. You have an admirable Repreſentation of this, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter, that was an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> Married to that great Prince of the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> of the God that <hi>made Heaven and Earth;</hi> VVhere it's ſaid, <hi>ver. 10. Hearken, O Daughter, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, and encline thine Ears, forget alſo thine own People, and thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Houſe; So ſhall the King greatly deſire thy Beauty, for he is thy Lord, and Worſhip thou him: The Kings Daughter is all Glorious within, her Cloathing is of wrought Gold, ſhe ſhall be brought unto the King in Rayment of Needle-Work; The Virgins the Companions that follow her, ſhall be brought unto thee: With gladneſs and rejoycing ſhall they be brought; They ſhall enter into the Kings Palace. Inſtead of thy Fathers ſhall be thy children, whom thou mayeſt make Princes in all the Earth;</hi> And ſo the <hi>Pſalm</hi> goes on in that ſame kind of Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which is chiefly intended of Chriſt, and his Church, of Chriſt and the Soul.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, I ſay to you, I ſay to every one; <hi>Hearken O Soul! Hearken, O Soul, and conſider; Forget thine own People, and thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Houſe;</hi> That is, Forget that State of Sin, and Vanity, and of the VVorld; All that thou deriveſt from the <hi>Firſt Adam thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> forget it all; <hi>So ſhall the King greatly deſire thy Beauty; for he is thy Lord, and Worſhip thou him.</hi> And if any thing ſeem valuable to us in this VVorld; Let us forget it all, that we may give up our ſelves to our Eſpouſed King. Ay, but how ſhall I leave my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures? How ſhall I leave this and that Enjoyment, this and that Relation that are ſo dear to me? VVhy, ſaith the Spirit of God, ver. 16. <hi>Inſtead of thy Fathers ſhall be thy children, whom thou mayeſt make Princes in all the Earth, I will make thy Name to be Remembred in all Generations, therefore ſhall the People praiſe thee for ever and ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That is, there ſhall be a great Recompence to every one, that leaves this VVorld, and the things of it, in their Affections, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote and give up themſelves to Chriſt. <hi>Inſtead of thy Fathers ſhall be thy children, whom thou mayeſt make Princes in all the Earth.</hi> Thou ſhalt have Recompences enough; And thou ſhalt be <hi>Praiſed for ever and ever.</hi> The Graces, the Priviledges, the Enjoyments ſhall be great, and thou ſhalt be Glorious for ever.</p>
                     <p>If therefore we could hearken, and encline to the Terms of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, if we could be willing to <hi>ſhave our Heads,</hi> and to <hi>Pare
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41902:19"/> our Nails,</hi> and to <hi>put off the Garments of our Captivity,</hi> The <hi>King would deſire</hi> our Beauty: Nay, indeed, He Loves, and Does all this for us, and makes us willing to have it all done. For a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Captivity is loved, while a Bodily Captivity is hated; We love the Garments of a Spiritual Captivity, even our Luſts and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and Worldly Enjoyments, which are the Garments of our Captivity; and They are ſo precious to us, we cannot Naturally endure to part with them, to be cloathed with <hi>change of Rayment,</hi> when Jeſus Chriſt, the Great Husband and Spouſe of our Souls is offered to us: And This Perpetuates our Captivity.</p>
                     <p>And thus I have made uſe of the Similitude, becauſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſo very admirable, and abundant in it.</p>
                     <p>I'll offer you One Scripture more, and ſo paſs on to the Second Particular. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2. God there compares his Church, and ſo every Soul, to an Impure and Adulterous Woman, that <hi>follows after her Lovers:</hi> But, ſaith God in the <hi>6th</hi> Ver. <hi>Therefore behold, I will hedge up thy way with Thorns, and make a Wall, that ſhe ſhall not find her paths. And ſhe ſhall follow after ber Lovers, but ſhe ſhall not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them: And ſhe ſhall ſeek them, but ſhe ſhall not find them: Then ſhall ſhe ſay, I'll go and return to my firſt Husband, for then was it better with me than now.</hi> Therefore (ſaith God in the <hi>4th</hi> Verſe) <hi>I'll allure her:</hi> That is, <hi>I'll ſpeak to her very heart. And I'll bring her into the Wilderneſs, and I'll draw her, and ſpeak every way to her heart;</hi> And then in the <hi>19th</hi> Verſe, <hi>I'll betroth thee unto me for ever; Yea, I'll betroth thee unto me in Righteouſneſs, and in Judgment, and in lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kindneſs, and in mercies.</hi> All this indeed, hath a peculiar Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Church of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> But it is true of every Soul, and of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Spirit, that Chriſt ſpeaks to, and draws to love him, as its <hi>Husband,</hi> and <hi>Spouſe:</hi> He doth <hi>allure,</hi> and ſpeak <hi>to their Hearts,</hi> He doth <hi>hedge up their way;</hi> If God ſee that any of His love the World, or Relations, or any Thing better than himſelf, He'll <hi>hedge up their way;</hi> They ſhall not find their way.</p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee there is a Time of Preparation, wherein Chriſt is fitting, and preparing, and drawing the Soul to Himſelf.</p>
                     <p>2. In the Second Particular I will enlarge a little further upon this Point of our <hi>Eſpouſals,</hi> and draw to a concluſion; and therein ſhew you, That we may all diſcern wherein, and whereby the Soul is thus drawn to an Union with Jeſus Chriſt, to this Spiritual Union with him.</p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:41902:20"/>
                     <p>1. In the firſt place; It is by the Souls ſeeing, and finding that it is in a miſerable, and a Loſt, and a Captivated condition without him; When it comes to find it ſelf in the Hands of Juſtice, In the Hands of Divine Wrath, and Indignation: When it finds it ſelf in all its Impurity, and in all its Unholineſs without Him, it comes then to deſire him, to receive his offer, to unite with him. Now, this is not onely by way (as ſome, it may be, have inſiſted upon it) by way of preparation, but it runs throughout all the preſent State. A true Chriſtian is continually looking upon himſelf, as a Captive; It is not a thing of preparation onely, But it flows out from the Efficacious Grace and Spirit of the Lord Jeſus; That eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Soul that is thus united to Chriſt, it finds, it does not know what to do with it ſelf without him; Nor that it is onely drawn by fear, but (as I ſhall preſently tell you, tho very Briefly) it is drawn by Love to him. But I ſay, becauſe we are Captives, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are brought out of another Land; a Land of Darkneſs, a Land of Impurity, a Land not ſuitable to the <hi>Land of Promiſe;</hi> becauſe we are brought out of that, Therefore there muſt be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual conſideration of the neceſſity, that lies upon us: And it is not Derogatory to our Love of Chriſt, or to the Grace of Chriſt, that our firſt State, being a Captivated State is known to us to be ſuch a Captive State; And therefore to be made Free by ſuch Rich Grace, as that the Great Prince and Lord of Life ſhould have a deſire to us, that he ſhould look upon that of his own Grace, which is all the Beauty that is in any, that God hath Loved them with an Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Love; the Beautiful Perſon is onely he, that God hath from an Eternal free Love, and Grace (when we were all together loſt and undone in our ſelves) look'd upon, and <hi>made his Time,</hi> in the proper ſeaſon of being brought home to him, tho we are found in all our Impurities, <hi>To be the Time of Love.</hi> How great is it!</p>
                     <p>Now, when any one of us is under this Grace of God, Jeſus Chriſt looks upon us; He beholds the choice of God, he beholds the Love of God upon us; And ſuch a one is as a Beautiful Perſon in his Eye: And ſo he takes care to <hi>Shave the Head,</hi> and to <hi>Pare the Nails,</hi> and to <hi>change the Garments of Captivity,</hi> and to bring him home to himſelf. This I ſay, it is not preparation Hammered out, and Anvil'd by our own ſtrength, Povver or Conſideration; but it is a firſt Davvn of the Grace of Chriſt, of the Love of Chriſt, through the Election and Choice of God upon us</p>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:41902:20"/>
                     <p>Here is the very Beginning of the thing. For, as I read to you out of <hi>Epheſ. 5. Chriſt Loves the Church</hi> firſt of all; and then he <hi>Sanctifies it,</hi> and <hi>Waſhes it with the Water,</hi> and <hi>with the Regeneration of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ord,</hi> and of his <hi>Spirit:</hi> He firſt of all Loves it <hi>Who Loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it.</hi> His Love is like the firſt Love of Eſpouſals, of drawing the Soul into a Condition, and State of Eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals to himſelf. And ſo he <hi>Sanctifies</hi> and <hi>Waſhes it with Water;</hi> and <hi>Regenerates</hi> and <hi>Renews</hi> it, and takes away the <hi>Priſon-Garments,</hi> the Captive-Garments; Which, it may be, look Beautiful to thoſe that are yet Enſnared; They look upon all the Enjoyments and Pleaſures of the World, to be the greateſt Bravery. But now, when Chriſt comes to ſhew them what their State is, then they come to cry out, at the firſt, and ſo ever after, as the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 7. 24. O wretched Man that I am, Who ſhalt deliver me from this Body of Death!</hi> And you ſee, he ſpeaks of it in the very ſame Language, (ver. 23.) <hi>I ſee another Law in my Members, warring againſt the Law of my mind, and bringing me into Captivity to the Law of Sin, which is in any Members.</hi> It is a continuing ſenſe on every Soul in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>2. The ſecond thing wherein this is ſhewed; It is in drawing the ſincereſt, and Pureſt, and Chaſteſt Love of the Soul unto Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>When Chriſt, by his Spirit, in his word, and by the <hi>Friend of the Bridegroom,</hi> that is, by the Preaching of the Word of Chriſt, when he draws the entireſt affections of Souls to himſelf; Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Love to them, in the Pardon and Forgiveneſs of Sins, he draws their hearts entirely, and unitedly to himſelf. He does there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, firſt of all, (as it were) ſend the Soul the Wedding Garment of his own Righteouſneſs; He ſends it a Robe, a Veſt, from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, of his own Righteouſneſs, and of the ſanctification of his own Spirit. And this enkindles, and enflames the Love of the Soul un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Jeſus Chriſt: The Apoſtle ſpeaks in this Language, in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1. VVould to God you could bear with me a little, <hi>&amp;c. For I am Jealous over you with a Godly Jealouſie: For I have Eſpouſed you to one Husband, that I may preſent you a chaſt Virgin to Chriſt.</hi> The Preaching of the Goſpel, and the drawing of Souls, it is the <hi>Eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal</hi> of them to <hi>one Husband,</hi> and preſenting them a <hi>Chast Virgin.</hi> That is, with undefiled, and Inviolable affections to Jeſus Chriſt: When the Love of the Soul is thus drawn to him, united to him, <hi>The upright,</hi> as I ſaid to you before, <hi>Love him.</hi> And when once this Love of the Soul to Jeſus Chriſt is indeed kindled, where it is
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41902:21"/> ſincere, and indeed kindled to him, O how ſtrong, and how vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is it!</p>
                     <p>It is true, it is from the Love of Jeſus Chriſt made known to it: Even as you know, Love draws and wins Love back again upon it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>This is admirably ſet out to us in the eighth Chapter of the <hi>Song</hi> of <hi>Solomon. Set me</hi> (ſaith ſhe) as a <hi>Seal upon thine Heart, as a Seal upon thine Arm. Let the Love of Christ</hi> be to me ſo, as <hi>if be ſet me as a Seal upon his Heart, as a Seal upon his Arm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the greateſt Indenture, the ſtrongeſt obligation and unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to the Soul, and of the Soul thereby to him again: for then, <hi>Love is as ſtrong as Death, and it is cruel as the Grave; The coals thereof are coals of Fire, which hath a moſt vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Flame; Many Waters cannot quench Love, neither can the flouds drown it: If a Man would give all the ſubſtance of his Houſe for Love.</hi> That is, to buy that Love off from Chriſt; That's the meaning of it; If a Man would give <hi>all the Subſtance of his Houſe,</hi> where Love is once fixed, to draw it off, <hi>It would utterly be contemned.</hi> Now this we ſhould look to, whether we have ſuch a chaſt, and Inviolable Love to Jeſus Chriſt, That all the ſubſtance of the VVorld would be utterly contemned? whether Chriſt hath <hi>Set us as a Seal upon his Heart,</hi> and <hi>Arm?</hi> It is impoſſible then, it ſhould ever be taken off.</p>
                     <p>3. The third is this, when once we come to be thus united to Chriſt, in the Chaſtneſs and Purity of our Affections, in the ſenſe of his Love to us, and our Love to him; Immediately there follows, and all along there follows a Self-Reſignation, and Obedience: And it cannot be otherwiſe. For Love from a worthy Perſon hath a great command over thoſe that are Loved; It hath a mighty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand on the Perſons Loved to engage to Love again; So that they are willing to do any thing, to give up themſelves to the will of the Perſon that Loves, and is Loved upon his Love firſt. And this is moſt due indeed to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; Becauſe he is the moſt excellent of all that can be propoſed to us; And he <hi>Hath Loved us, and Waſhed us in his Blood;</hi> And he thus wins us to his own Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. Saith the Apoſtle, the <hi>Church is Subject unto Christ, as unto the Head,</hi> the <hi>Saviour of the Body.</hi> It is in a perfect complyance with the Holy will of God.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>If you ll ſay, But how can we ſay this? We find many Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections in our Obedience, many Motions in our Hearts, that are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyal
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41902:21"/> to Jeſus Chriſt, and are not at all according to the Obligations that lie upon us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe we are going on to perfection in this ſtate, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we find that we are under a Degree of Captivity, and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly freed; Therefore the Soul cries out earneſtly for the coming of the Great <hi>Bridegroom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall but make Two or Three Expreſſions of Application, and ſo conclude this Point.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the Firſt Place, I beſeech you, that you would conſider what your Chriſtianity is: If it be not ſo ſtrict an Adherence of your Souls and Affections to Chriſt, as every wiſe, and prudent, and good Husband requires and expects from his Wife: I ſay, if it be not ſo, how is it poſſible that you can ſay, That <hi>Chriſt is mine,</hi> and <hi>I am his?</hi> And therefore look well to it, and have a <hi>Jealous Eye,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>I am Jealous over you with a Godly Jealouſie;</hi> So we ſhould be All Jealous over our own Hearts, and the Motions of our Eyes, to ſee whether there be ſuch a <hi>Faithfullneſs to Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as ought to be: VVhen the Church is Subject to Chriſt, (as the moſt Excellent and Virtuous VVoman, and VVife, is to the moſt Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable and Worthy Husband;) There is not any thing then, that can, or ought, or is poſſible to come between our Souls, and Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>And, If we cry out, Alas! We are not able hereunto, we do not find this.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall after, by the Grace and Aſſiſtance of God, preſs upon you; Every ſuch Diſcovery of the remaining defection and falſeneſs of our hearts, It ſhould make us cry out earneſtly, <hi>Come thou Beloved of my Soul;</hi> That there may be an entire and a perfect Union between me and thee; Betwixt thy ſelf and my heart. This, it ſhould make us weary of the World, and weary of Life, and weary of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State; We cannot find our hearts come up, as we deſire they ſhould. But in the mean time, there is a True, and a Real, and a Subſtantial Faithfulneſs, and Purity, and Chaſtity of Affections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Chriſt in every Soul that is His: That tho there are things that do not look ſo Reſigning to Chriſt, as they ſhould do, and ſo perfectly complyant; Yet the Spirit is United to him: As the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks by way of Alluſion to this very thing, in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. latter end. But <hi>he that is Joyned to the Lord, is one Spirit.</hi> That is, in regard of the preſent State of Fleſh and Blood, there will be ſome Wandrings of Heart; But the Spirit is Stedfaſt and Jealous over
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41902:22"/> thoſe Unholy and Impure motions towards Sin, Fleſh, and the World, and it gathers it ſelf back, and it humbles it ſelf; And it bewails it ſelf, in regard of the <hi>Trayterouſneſs</hi> of the Fleſh, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt part, wherein it does any way behave it ſelf unworthily to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that Saviour of it ſelf; <hi>He is the Saviour of the Body,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Church is Subject to him.</hi> And then,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In the Second Place; It ſhould teach us very vehemently, to look and cry out for that Time of free and full <hi>Enjoyments of Chriſt.</hi> I wonder we ſhould not be earneſtly deſirous, when I conſider the Reaſon, the neceſſity, and the great obligation which lies upon us; I wonder, we are not more earneſt to dye, and to be with Chriſt; we are apt to think there is a State of the World ordained, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we ſhould have ſuch, and ſuch <hi>Enjoyments,</hi> and bear up our ſelves for a Time; While in the mean time, we forget <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> But hereafter, it will be endeavoured to be made plain, in this Diſcourſe, that either to go out of the Body, and to be with <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> in Spirit; Or to have the whole frame of this VVorld unpinn'd and diſ-joynted one part from another; That there may come that <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and that <hi>Marriage</hi> of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> and <hi>coming down</hi> of that <hi>New-Jeruſalem;</hi> (And our ſelves as a part of it) as a <hi>Bride adorned for her Husband,</hi> is the Inward Groan of every Saint. Theſe things ſhould be ſweet to us: And we ſhould not be Gulp'd down by the preſent <hi>Temptations</hi> of the World, which have ſo much force, becauſe our hearts are not ſteady to Chriſt; O Let us look earneſtly for that Love, which many <hi>Waters cannot quench,</hi> nor the <hi>Flouds drown.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And, If we find, that we cannot be, as we would be; We ſhould therefore cry out, <hi>Make haſte, O Beloved; And appear upon the Mountain of Spices!</hi> That we may be for ever quiet, and Pure, and Un-interrupted in our Love unto thee, and receiving thine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</p>

                     <p>I Have entered into this Great Parable of the <hi>Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> And to ſhew you, That the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> is from the very Beginning, to the End of it, <hi>The Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> And that the Principal Point of the Kingdom, as Now, is, The Eſpouſing of the Spirits of his Saints unto Himſelf; That in the Glorious Solemnity of the <hi>Marriage of the Lamb,</hi> They may be <hi>Bidden</hi> to that <hi>Marriage-Supper:</hi> As the Expreſſion is in the <hi>Revelation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall now go on, as I intimated to you the Laſt Day, to ſhew you, That <hi>This Preparation for the Marriage, or for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Chriſt, in that Great Glory and Solemnity of his Kingdom, is Now: And all Chriſtianity looks to That:</hi> I ſay, <hi>It looks to that Glorious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity.</hi> The Preparation is begun Now, and then is the Glorious Solemnity. But in the Time of the Preparation, in the very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Time, the Souls and Spirits of the Servants of Chriſt, move with an Earneſt Deſire towards that Glory. They are, They ought to be moved to a deſire of the Glory of the Kingdom of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. And All our Religion, All our Chriſtianity, All our Praying and Hearing, and Preaching, All the Graces that we La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour after, our Faith and Repentance, our Holineſs, our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; All theſe, they are to be Erected, they are to be lifted up, to be raiſed up to the Glory, and to the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt; So that we ought to have an Eye in Every Thing, to that State: For ſo you ſee it is here ſaid, <hi>Ver. 1. There were Virgins going forth to meet the Bridegroom. They took their Lamps, and they went forth to meet the Bridegroom.</hi> Though the <hi>Bridegroom delayed his coming,</hi> and did not come ſo ſoon as they might think, yet ſtill they went <hi>forth to meet the Bridegroom.</hi> All True Power of Grace and Holineſs, and (as we ſpeak) of Religion; To be Religious; It is to <hi>go forth to meet
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41902:23"/> the Bridegroom:</hi> This is the Great Senſe of it. Not that we ſhall be perfect here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in any Regard; But our Perfection is in that Kingdom and Glory of Chriſt; It is in that Solemnity: And therefore it is our Great Miſtake, if we lay our Chriſtianity lower than This; If we don't Elevate, and Lift it up to This very Great Point, to <hi>meet the Bridegroom:</hi> Our <hi>Lamp</hi> (that is, our Profeſſion, and our Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Chriſtianity now, and in all the Ordinances of it, and in all the Graces of it) is to this very purpoſe, That we might be Daily <hi>meeting of the Bridegroom;</hi> That we might be fit to <hi>meet the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom,</hi> and might bear up with the Glory, Greatneſs and Excellency of that Solemnity.</p>
                     <p>I ſpoke to you the Laſt Day, of the <hi>Captive</hi> Perſon, that appeared Beautiful in the Eyes of Him <hi>that had taken her captive:</hi> And, if it was ſo, that he deſired to Eſpouſe her, ſhe was to abide <hi>Thirty Days before the Marriage.</hi> That is, There was to be a Time of Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But now, I beſeech you to conſider, All that very <hi>Time</hi> which we read of, in <hi>Deut. 21. 10. Her Head was to be ſhaved, and her Nails to be pared, and the Rayment of her Captivity was to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off from her; and ſhe was to continue in the houſe of him that lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her; and to bewail her Father, and her Mother, a full month.</hi> That is, Becauſe ſhe was taken <hi>Captive,</hi> and taken from her neareſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; and was thus to be <hi>waſhed, and her Head ſhaven, and her Nails pared.</hi> She was to be under ſuch a Preparation all that full Month, becauſe a Pagan, a <hi>Stranger from the Commonwealth of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael:</hi> As I ſaid to you, in the Expreſſion of <hi>David: Forget thine own People, and thy Father's Houſe:</hi> So Chriſt gives us a Time of Preparation, a Time of <hi>ſhaving our Heads, and paring our Nails, and taking off the Garments of our Captivity,</hi> of our Corrupt and Impure State: We have a <hi>Month for this:</hi> That is, ſuch a Time as God allows <hi>his Servants</hi> here in the World; and ſuch a Time <hi>as his Church hath</hi> before the Glory of the Nuptials, of the Wedding, and of his Kingdom. And they are all this Time to bewail that State, that loſt and undone State, wherein they are by Nature: And all rhat Time now, that ſuch <hi>Captives</hi> were under this <hi>Months</hi> Delay, under this <hi>Months</hi> Preparation; Undoubtedly, they had a Great Reſpect to the Honour, and to the Glory of <hi>the Nuptial Solemnity;</hi> they did every thing with an Eye to that, and with an Order to that: And if it had not been ſo to be Accompliſhed; All the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, All that was meant by that of <hi>ſhaving the Hair,</hi> and <hi>paring the Nails,</hi> and <hi>taking off the Garments of Captivity,</hi> had been to no
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41902:23"/> purpoſe, ſhe had been turned out again, and been a Slave for ever, All theſe methods had been in vain; But becauſe there was ſo Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable an Intention, as that of Marriage; That made all this eaſy and ſweet, and there was an Eye to it all along. In the very ſame manner, if we have not an Eye to the Wedding; If we Love and Deſire to ſtay in the State on Earth, and not to come to the Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the Nuptials, to be the <hi>Bride</hi> and the <hi>Spouſe of Chriſt;</hi> We lay all our Religion and Profeſſion too low.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, I ſhall deſire to diſcourſe this Point to you ſo, as may move you moſt to draw up your hearts, not to a Chriſtianity, as it is now, but as it ſhall be in Glorious Solemnity of the <hi>Marriage of the Lamb:</hi> And to teach you, that our Eye is to be all along up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that, and to diſcover to you the Greatneſs of the miſtake, in doing otherwiſe, I ſhall therefore diſcourſe theſe Heads up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> To open to you, what it is to be a Chriſtian, and to be Religious, and to be Godly, as we uſually ſpeak, with an Eye to that future State, to that Glorious State of the <hi>Wedding</hi> of our Lord Jeſus, And of our ſelves to be Married in Glory to Him. And then,</p>
                     <p>In the Second Place, I ſhall ſhew you the Great Reaſons, why this, and nothing elſe, is the Truth and Reality of Chriſtianity. And then,</p>
                     <p>In the Third Place, I'll ſhew you how it hath come to paſs, that this great Aim and Deſignation of Chriſtianity is fallen ſo very low, as it is in the World. And then,</p>
                     <p>In the Fourth Place, I will Anſwer Objections to you by which you may ſeem to think, or it may ſeem to you, that this is not ſo neceſſary, and abſolutely needful Doctrine, as I hope it will appear to you; And then,</p>
                     <p>In the Laſt Place, I'll cloſe with the application of it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt therefore, I begin to explain it to you, what it is to order our ſelves ſo, as if there was nothing to come after, or as if we did not care how long the <hi>Month of Preparation</hi> and <hi>Purification</hi> were drawn out; And what it is in every thing to have our hearts raiſed and lifted up to this excellent end, to this Glorious Point and Concluſion of the <hi>Marriage.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt therefore, you muſt conſider, that we are all naturally upon this, to fix a State here in this World; I ſay, we are naturally upon this, to fix a State, as much as we can here in this World; We
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41902:24"/> would have the Intereſt of this World to ſtand; We would have <hi>Buying</hi> and <hi>Selling,</hi> and <hi>Planting,</hi> and <hi>Building,</hi> and <hi>Marrying,</hi> and <hi>Giving in Marriage;</hi> We would have theſe things continue, and the Breeding up of Children for it, in ſucceſſive Generations; And we never care nor deſire to have an End of this; but we would have the World go on, and we deſire to live as long in it, every one of us, as we can; And to have as much Intereſt in it, to have as much Enjoyment of it, to have as much of the Riches, and of the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, and of the Honour, and of the Pleaſure, and of the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, as we can: This is natural to us.</p>
                     <p>But now, when we come to raiſe our Chriſtianity indeed; We are not ſo much upon this World, but our Great thought is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the future State, the future Kingdom, and the future Glory: We are looking beyond this, we are dealing with this World, as that that muſt wane, that muſt Decreaſe and Decay, and we deſire it ſhould: We have inſpected it; We have weighed it, and found it <hi>too Light</hi> every way; And therefore we cannot be content with it; But we are weary of the ſtay, and of the delay of it.</p>
                     <p>When we go forth indeed, with our <hi>Lamps</hi> to meet the <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom,</hi> We do thus; I ſay, we do thus. It is true indeed, we all profeſs this; We pretend to it; It is the very neceſſary obligation of our Profeſſion, to do thus, and to ſay, and to carry it before all, that we do thus: But now, if you do but attend, and hearken to the whiſpers of your own hearts, and to the diſcourſes that are in the VVorld, and that we have one with another, You may plainly find, we deſire, that the VVorld ſhould be <hi>Eternal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is noted to be the great miſtake and deception of ſome natural Phyloſophers, that they believed, the VVorld was Eternal, was from Eternity; That it was always; And ſo it is an Eternal VVorld, as they ſpeak a <hi>Parte-Ante;</hi> From the former part of it, it hath been always: And, Indeed, it is as Great, and as Ruinous a miſtake in point of Practice, that we deſire the World ſhould be for ever, that it ſhould continue for ever in this very State, wherein it is. It is true indeed, it is a very Atheiſtick Principle, to think, that the World was from Eternity; And it would follow, if ſo, that it muſt be to Eternity. But, I am not minding that Point now, but onely allude to it; That as they thought the World was from Eternity, So we deſire it ſhould be to Eternity. And, it is as ſtrange a thing to us, to be made to believe the End of the World, and the End of the State of things, with any Definitiveneſs, or with any certainty,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41902:24"/> as it was to the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they came to underſtand that Chriſt did not intend an immediate Kingdom, in their <hi>Jewiſh</hi> State, and in that preſent World. This preſent World is ſo exceeding Natural to us, That you ſee Men Purchaſe, as if the World was ſtill to laſt Ages: And who knows when it ſhall have an End? And therefore Men deſire to Propagate all the Worlds concernments, even to Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity.</p>
                     <p>But now, when a Chriſtian comes indeed to conſider; He always ſets the Bounds by his own thoughts to the World, he ſets Bounds to the preſent Condition, by Powerful and Effective thoughts of Eternity. Saith he, this World is not to laſt, I muſt deal with it, as with a World that is not to laſt.</p>
                     <p>Obſerve how the Apoſtle ſpeaks: Indeed, I might give you many abundant Scriptures, to ſhew you how much their thoughts were upon the End of things; <hi>The End of all things is at Hand.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> tells us, the <hi>Faſhion,</hi> the <hi>Scheme</hi> of this <hi>World paſſeth away.</hi> And, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> Chap. 7. That I would deſire you to conſider of; Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>Time is ſhort:</hi> And it ſhall come very ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to that; <hi>That they that Marry ſhould be as if they Marryed not; And they that Weep, as tho they Wept not; And they that Laugh, as if they rejoyced not; And they that buy, as if they poſſeſſed not..</hi> Ver. 29. Now this indeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was ſpoken Sixteen Hundred Years ago; But we are now, as unwilling to believe, that time is ſhorter, as any could be in thoſe Days; And are as tender, that any one ſhould meddle with ſuch a Point, that the preſent State ſhould be at an End: And every one deſires Life, in his own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; is afraid of dying, and afraid of Growing old, of growing near to the Grave; It is a very Melancholy proſpect, (as we ſay) a Melancholy diſcourſe, any thing that looks to this point.</p>
                     <p>But now, our going forth to meet the <hi>Bridegoom,</hi> it muſt be much otherwiſe; We read that the time is ſhort; And the VVorld conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually paſſing and fleeting away; Therefore remember indeed, what you pretend to, whether you do it, or not; That you may bring your ſelves to the very thing, to do it; that is, that you are daily going out <hi>To meet the Bridegroom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For, on this other ſide; A Servant of God, he looks (as I may ſay) Bolt upright; he lifts up his head, he raiſes up himſelf, to look up to that <hi>World to come,</hi> whereof (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>We ſpeak,</hi> our Diſcourſe is of that. VVe look Bolt upright to that, we deſire to get above this VVorld, and to call for, and pray for, and Covet that State of the <hi>World that is to come.</hi> It is indeed, ſo great an Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41902:25"/> of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> that I ſhall onely make uſe of that, in this preſent Caſe, and ſo paſs on. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 12. Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for and haſting unto the coming of the Day of God;</hi> VVhen we are in haſte, that that day ſhould come; This is to go forth to <hi>meet the Bridegroom,</hi> when our earneſt deſires are to that</p>
                     <p>VVe Love all the Exchangings of this Life, the variety of the ſpending of our Time in it; So much in ſleeping, ſo much in Eating and Drinking; So much in Dreſſing; So much in Buying and Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; So much in viſiting, and going about to talk of things, that are of no moment. But now, a Chriſtian goes out with his <hi>Lamp</hi> to <hi>meet the Bridegroom:</hi> Even a Fooliſh Chriſtian pretends to this, But a VViſe Chriſtian really doth it. And therefore, what cauſe have we to conſider this? To be aſhamed, that we bear the Glory of this no more?</p>
                     <p>A Second Particular, in which I'll open it to you. A Man that is a Chriſtian, (But onely a <hi>Fooliſh Virgin</hi>) he conſiders how much Religion will ſerve the preſent Turn, the preſent Caſe.</p>
                     <p>For, you know (and it is very evident) that the VVorld can be no more without Religion, than it can be without Meat and Drink, and without Light; I mean, ſome form, or ſome way of Religion; All Nations, and all Perſons have found ſome kind of neceſſity of it; For, firſt of all, we don't know how to put out that natural Light, that is in every Man's Conſcience; All the wit that ever has been in the VVorld, and the ſharpeſt Atheiſtical Reaſon, could never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail to this, to caſt it out of the humane Underſtanding and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                     <p>A Man may caſt it out of Practical Conſcience; But he can never caſt it out of that Intellectual, Convicting and Convincing Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: Now, becauſe we muſt, and would have ſome peace in our ſelves; VVe muſt have ſome Religion; Or elſe Conſcience will grumble, and be diſquiet, and out of Eaſe, and out of Temper, if there be nothing to Lull it, and ſatisfy it, that there is ſome ſort of Religion in Men. And then, Governours, and Rulers, even down to Maſters of Families, they find a neceſſity of Religion to Govern Mankind: It would not be Governed, if there were not ſome Awe, and Power of Religion upon Men; If there were not ſome Diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Good and Evil. So this brings ſomething more of Religion ſtill. And then,</p>
                     <p>VVhen Laws of Nations come to make Religion a Faſhion, and to make it a thing (as we ſpeak) Eſtabliſht by Law; Then there
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41902:25"/> comes a further neceſſity; For, if a Man does nothing in Anſwer to this; He is look'd upon, as a kind of a <hi>Boutefeu,</hi> one that diſturbs the world; And, Indeed, it is the greateſt Diſturbance to a Nation, to deny Religion; To deny the Being of a God; To deny the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between Good and Evil. And then,</p>
                     <p>Men have hope that God will Bleſs them, when they are Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious; And therefore, if they do not Pray, if they do not Read the word of God, and do ſomething; How (ſay they) ſhould God Bleſs us? Here's a further reaſon of Religion. And then there is a Temper in Men, an Inclination, ſome in one way, and ſome in another.</p>
                     <p>And God is pleaſed in the way of Common Providence, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the World to Imprint ſome ſenſe, and awe of himſelf upon ſome more than others; And yet all this may be laid to the very preſent State of this World, How elſe ſhould we live, Men ſay? or how ſhould we expect a Bleſſing from Heaven? And when Men are entred into a Profeſſion, and are in a way of Profeſſion; They ſay, my Credit depends upon it, and my Reputation bears upon it, that I ſhould maintain and carry on a Profeſſion.</p>
                     <p>But now, beyond all this, a True Servant of God, one that is truely Eſpouſed to Jeſus Chriſt, and hath Bride-like affection unto him, ſaith, tho there were not the leaſt reaſon of Religion, upon any Account whatſoever of this World; Yet I look for the <hi>Coming of the Bridegroom,</hi> and I deſire to be given up to him: For, there's my Happineſs, and my Eternal Enjoyment; And therefore I look not what will ſatisfy the World; For, if a Man be blameleſs in the Duties in Publick, and have them in his Family; All this is ſuited to the very Good of the preſent World; If a Man minded his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the preſent World, He would take care of all this.</p>
                     <p>But now a Chriſtian will ask, what Godlineſs is that, that will be accepted at the coming of the <hi>Bridegroom?</hi> What is that Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that Faith, that Holineſs, that Praying, that Hearing, that will be found unto Honour and Praiſe at the coming of the <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom?</hi> What muſt that kind of Grace be, that will bear, and hold up, That will be as <hi>Oyl in the Veſſel,</hi> and in the Treaſure, when <hi>I meet the Bridegroom?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I am not concerned, whether the World ſpeaks well, or ill of my Profeſſion: Not, but that a Man ought to have Reſpect to that, which is truly <hi>Praiſe Worthy,</hi> and of <hi>Good Report.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:41902:26"/>
                     <p>But that, ſaith the upright Soul, is not my End: But I have all my Relation to the coming of my <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> and I look up to Him in all, how he is like to accept of my Way, and of my Services. And this the Apoſtle, in another Caſe, (But yet that may be very fairly, and well uſed in Relation to this) In that, 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 23. He that is Married, careth for the things, that are of the World, how he may pleaſe his Wife. He that is unmarried</hi> (ver. 32.) <hi>Careth for the things that belong to the Lord,</hi> how he may <hi>pleaſe the Lord.</hi> I would onely a little vary, and ſay.</p>
                     <p>That that Man that deſires indeed to prepare, in every thing, to <hi>meet the Bridegroom;</hi> He <hi>takes care in</hi> every thing, how he may <hi>pleaſe the Lord;</hi> How he may Pray, and Hear, and Believe, and Repent, and Turn to God; How he may ſpeak, and think, and act in every Affair, and in every Buſineſs to <hi>pleaſe the Lord:</hi> For (ſaith he) with this, I am to <hi>meet the Bridegroom,</hi> And therefore I would know how it takes with him, and how it is accepted by him. And this is for a Man to go forth with his <hi>Lamp,</hi> to <hi>meet the Bridegrom,</hi> like a <hi>Wiſe Virgin,</hi> And not like a <hi>Fooliſh one.</hi> For the <hi>Fooliſh Virgins</hi> (undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) they had enough to bear out in this World. I don't think, but our Lord's Intention in this Parable, was to ſignify, that the <hi>Fooliſh Virgins</hi> were every way as fair to the Eye, as the <hi>Wiſe Virgins</hi> were, in their <hi>going forth,</hi> and in their <hi>Lamps;</hi> But here lay the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; The <hi>Wiſe Virgins</hi> Aimed at that, that would ſtand, in the day when the <hi>Bridegroom came;</hi> And they to go to the Marriage. And therefore, let's look back in every thing, and compare our ſelves, with what I have ſpoken: Let there be a Brief Application, and a Brief Reflection by every one upon our ſelves, ſo far as I have gone.</p>
                     <p>I come now to the ſecond thing; And that is, to prove to you, that if our Religion ſhould be no better, nor no higher; If It had no higher End, nor buſineſs, than onely to comport to the preſent State of this world, It were nothing indeed, at all, if it be not raiſed much higher, in being prepared to <hi>meet,</hi> and to Enjoy the <hi>Bridegroom.</hi> Therefore we ſhould haſte on, that's the thing I am upon, to prove to you, that we ought to haſte on to the Day of God; And, I ſuppoſe a Man to live as unblameably, as every one would deſire he ſhould; To be as diligent in the Duties of Chriſtanity, as any one can expect from him; To be as ready to do good, and to be merciful to any one; And as Juſt, as Sober, and as Temperate, every way ſuch, as you would deſire him to be: And yet, if he
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41902:26"/> hath not an Eye to this, to meet the <hi>Bridegroom;</hi> If he hath not a higher Aim, a higher Deſign of Soul, I'll ſhew you (I hope to the Conviction of every Perſon) that his Religion, his Chriſtianity, his Goodneſs, (whatever you'll call it) It lies much too low; And,</p>
                     <p>The Firſt Argument, by which I would convince you of it, is This.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. Suppoſe a Man never ſo Good in himſelf, yet it is plain, and undeniable, that there is a mighty wicked world, every way round about: Now, if a Man truely Loves God and Chriſt, the wickedneſs that abounds in the world and ſo over-flows, it would make him deſire that there ſhould be another State of things: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he be a Man that Swears not, why yet, when he hears thoſe Vollies of Oaths and Blaſphemies, that are every where about him; And ſo in every other ſuch Inſtance: This is a reaſon for him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> ſhould come; Becauſe there is ſuch a wicked, ſuch an Intollerable wicked World.</p>
                     <p>God's heart cannot be to this wicked world, tho <hi>Noah, Job,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> and all the Great Worthies ſhould ſtand before him for this world; Yet his heart could not be to this world, becauſe of the abundance of wickedneſſes that are in it; Separate from it the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of, in Compariſon, the few Servants of God in it; And Oh the abundance of wickedneſs that is in it, and of wicked Men!</p>
                     <p>There was undoubtedly a ſucceſſion of Holy <hi>Patriarchs</hi> to the <hi>Floud;</hi> And undoubtedly, they had many Godly Children, and Godly Friends, one with another; And yet for all that, God's Heart could not be to that <hi>Old World;</hi> But he muſt needs deſtroy it: And ſo, God's Heart cannot be to this world; That now is, but he is reſolved to burn it about the Ears of all the wicked that are in it.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, becauſe of this, a Good Man, tho he be never ſo Good, and Suppoſe, he have very Great and High Enjoyments of God, in himſelf; and ſuppoſe, he hath many Godly Friends, and Relations, and Acquaintance, that are really and truely Religious, and Holy Perſons; yet, for all this, I cannot (ſaith he) endure this world; Or for all that, wherein I walk with God my ſelf, or wherein I have any, or know any that walk with him; After all this, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the Good, that you can find, or hope you can find in the world, yet there are ſuch an abundance of wicked in it, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of this, his Zeal riſes up to the coming of the <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41902:27"/> to the <hi>meeting of the Bridegroom:</hi> He looks for, and <hi>Haſtens on to the Day of God,</hi> becauſe of this.</p>
                     <p>Now, certainly, this is a very undeniable Argument; Who can take Pleaſure? Knowing, that there are ſo many wicked Men <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on Horſeback;</hi> (To uſe that Expreſſion of <hi>Solomon</hi>) That there is in all places, Employments, Cities, Towns, and Neighbourhoods, ſuch great Ignorance of God, and contempt of Him, and Jeſus Chriſt, and ſuch wicked Converſation; a Good Man cannot be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but he muſt deſire the <hi>Coming of the Bridegroom.</hi> Conſider that Example we have in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7. God <hi>delivered Juſt Lot,</hi> (as the Criticks obſerve, He was tormented after the manner of the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell) <hi>vexed with the filthy Converſation of the wicked. For that righteous Man dwelling among them, in ſeeing and hearing, vexed his righteous Soul from day to day, with their unlawful deeds;</hi> or, <hi>with their enormous deeds.</hi> So I ſay, when we conſider the Great Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities that are in the World, who indeed, that is a Chriſtian, but would ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Oh that the <hi>Bridegroom would come,</hi> and put an end to this? <hi>Wo is me, that I ſojourn in Meſech, that I dwell in the Tents of Kedar!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. In the Second Place, Suppoſe that we could overcome, and ſalve our ſelves of this Reaſon of Deſiring the <hi>Bridegroom's Coming,</hi> and might ſay, notwithſtanding this, That <hi>we and our Houſes ſerve God;</hi> and that <hi>our Converſation is as becomes the Goſpel;</hi> and that we deſire to converſe with <hi>Saints;</hi> and that we have an Heavenly Society up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earrh; I ſay, ſuppoſe this could be ſaid, where there is not an High Senſe of the <hi>Bridegroom's Coming;</hi> yet <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>Horror hath taken hold upon me, becauſe they keep not thy Law. It is time for the Lord to mork:</hi> (I wonder thou ſtayeſt ſo long) <hi>for they have made void thy Law.</hi> And <hi>Rivers of Tears run down mine eyes, becauſe they keep not thy Law.</hi> All this, I ſay, plainly proves, That if a man could ſalve the firſt Conſideration to himſelf, yet he cannot bear out him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on this Account.</p>
                     <p>O! when any of us come to look ſeriouſly into our own Hearts, Lives and Ways; can we ſay, That we are what we deſire to be, and what vve vvould be? Have vve ſuch a Tenor of Thoughts, ſuch a conſtant Chain of Holy, and Serious, and Wiſe Thoughts? Do we keep our Mouths with a <hi>Bit</hi> and <hi>Bridle, while the wicked is before us?</hi> Do we take care to ſpeak always ſo, That our <hi>Speech is ſeaſoned with Salt,</hi> and that it <hi>miniſters Grace to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers?</hi> Are our Hearts ſo in the Enjoyment of God, and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41902:27"/> with him; That we may ſay, <hi>It is Good for us to be here?</hi> Or, do we meet, in ſuch Ordinances Publickly Adminiſtred, with ſuch Power, and Powerful Preaching, Goſpel Adminiſtrations, The Lords Supper, Keeping and Obſerving the Lords Day, as we deſire? Do we find that there is ſo much in theſe, That we can our ſelves ſay, we have Reaſon to reſt here, or to continue in this State?</p>
                     <p>Or, do we not find a continual complaint? Like that of <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. <hi>The Good, that I would, I do not: But the Evil which I would not, that I do. I find then a Law, that when I would do Good, Evil is preſent with me.</hi> And ſo in Verſe 24. He comes to cry out, <hi>O wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the Body of this Death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If this World could ſtand, Yet <hi>This Body of Sin and Death</hi> is ſuch, that I could wiſh it were at an End. Who ſhall reſcue and unchain me from this <hi>Body,</hi> wherein I am Fettered and Held, that I cannot do the things that I deſire to do, to the Glory of God in it? So that there is a Chain upon our Minds and Hearts, That the very conſideration of it ſhould make us earneſtly deſire the <hi>coming of the Bridegroom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. A Third Conſideration: Suppoſe now, neither of theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſufficient, why we ſhould deſire the <hi>coming</hi> of the <hi>Bridegroom;</hi> Yet, I beſeech you, conſider, whether the Glory of Chriſt be not a proper and Condign Object of our deſires? Whether it be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of him, that he ſhould have no higher, nor more Glorious State in this World, than he yet hath? Can you be content, that the Nations ſhould be given to Idolatry, or <hi>Mahometaniſm</hi> among the <hi>Turks?</hi> Would you be willing the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſhould have ſo great a part of the Chriſtian World, ſtill under their Darkneſs, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition? Would you be willing that ſo many Tyrants as have, and ſo many as are ready ſtill to do it, ſhould be Riding over the Heads of the Saints and Servants of God, and that his Worſhip ſhould be caſt down to the Ground? And that the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> ſhould be <hi>Trodden underfoot by the Gentiles?</hi> And that the <hi>Abomination of Deſolation ſhould stand where it ought not?</hi> Could any Man, that Loves the Glory of God, and the Glory of Chriſt, be content with this? Who does not (that is ſeriouſly a Chriſtian) long, That might be fulfilled? <hi>From the Riſing of the Sun, to the going down of the ſame, Thy Name, O Lord, ſhall be Great. That Chriſt ſhould have his Portion given Him with the Great, and with the Strong; That the Ends of the Earth ſhould be His; That Knowledge ſhould cover the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41902:28"/> Earth, as the Waters do the Sea.</hi> If any Love God, and Love Chriſt; I appeal to you, whether we could be content, Things ſhould be as they are, and not as they are thus foretold?</p>
                     <p>Let me make a plain, and a Familiar Compariſon, and bring it to our ſelves: I would ſuppoſe now, as I know, there are many that are Zealous in this Nation, for <hi>King James:</hi> They know he is out of the Nation, and (as it were) an Exile from them: And tho they may have a Great, Plentiful, Competent Eſtates, and Great Riches: Yet they think, things are not well, and as they ſhould be: Becauſe they ſay, things are not as they ſhould be, to exclude a Juſt and Lawful Prince as they think.</p>
                     <p>I make onely this Alluſion; My Judgment is enough known.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſe, any Profeſs to Love Jeſus Chriſt; Then think with your ſelves, whether it can conſiſt with your Loyalty to Chriſt, with your deſire of his Glory, and his Kingdom, that it ſhould be at ſo low an Ebb as it is? Now I am ſure, if you weighed theſe, and much more that might be ſaid, and all of them together; You would plainly ſay, that there can be no Truth, nor no Loyalty of Chriſtianity, without an Earneſt Deſire and Preparation in your ſelves continually, for the <hi>Bridegrooms coming.</hi> Surely, to be Rich onely, as to this world, and after the rate and paſs of it, and to <hi>our ſelves,</hi> can no way ſatisfy a <hi>Wiſe Virgin</hi> in Chriſtianity.</p>
                     <p>But now, Alas! We may ſee it very much otherwiſe; who can but obſerve it every where, and with all manner of Perſons, that we may converſe with, of the Higher, and Lower Degree, even of the <hi>Firſt Three</hi> (as I may ſpeak) in Chriſtianity; (As it was ſaid of <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Worthies</hi>) I ſay, if you take even thoſe of the <hi>Firſt Three;</hi> We cannot but ſay, there's too Great a Byaſs, too Great a Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, too Great an Inclination and Poize of Men, towards this VVorld; They are for every thing Pleaſing, and Deſirable, and Pleaſurably affecting in it: And they hold off as much as they can from a belief of the nearneſs of the coming of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Now, how comes this to paſs in the VVorld? Give me leave, very briefly, to Repreſent the reaſons of this to you, and the way, or method, how theſe things have come into the VVorld.</p>
                     <p>I am ſure, I may, without any uncharitableneſs, or untenderneſs, ſay, that the Religion and Chriſtianity of not one of a Hundred, but is onely Calculated for the preſent State: And they would, that all the State, and Trade, and Government, and the VVealth,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41902:28"/> and Peace, and Plenty, and Proſperity of it, ſhould go on ſtill, Than that there ſhould be an approach of the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt. The Reaſons of theſe things, I'll give you in theſe three Particulars.</p>
                     <p>1. The firſt is; It comes to paſs by the <hi>Bridegrooms Delaying his coming,</hi> that hath given the Advantage and Opportunity to this State of Things; if Chriſt had come as ſoon as he Roſe, as ſoon as ever he ſent forth the Apoſtolick Preachers; Things would have been found in a far other temper, than now; For when I come, (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>Shall I find Faith on the Earth?</hi> But now it was ſo neceſſary for Him, in the Wiſdom of the Father, and in his own wiſdom, to delay his coming, that, he Swore; It was a thing of ſo great concernment, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. That there ſhould be <hi>Time, Times,</hi> and <hi>Half a Time,</hi> before his coming ſhould be: So he did <hi>Chronize,</hi> he drew out Time, till his coming; And that hath given Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to all that Deadneſs of Chriſtianity, to all that low poſture of things. So the Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Theſ. 2. That day cannot come except there be a falling away first.</hi> Thus the day was Poſt-pon'd, it could not come; And ſo obſerve, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. Where the <hi>Bridegroom Delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his coming, they all ſlumbred and ſlept.</hi> Ver. 5. While the <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom tarryed, they all ſlumbred and ſlept.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in <hi>Match.</hi> 24. Pray obſerve, how the Spirit of God Inſiſts upon this, that there was a delay of the coming of Chriſt. <hi>ver. 48. But, and if that Evil Servant ſhall ſay in his heart, my Lord delayeth his coming,</hi> &amp;c. So here's the ſleep, and ſpace given, for the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſuch ſleep, ſuch a low State in Chriſtianity, as there is by <hi>Chriſt delaying his coming.</hi> Some are ready to ſay, he'll never come, there will never be any ſuch thing: Why is it not ſooner? Why has it been ſo long? Men have time to do ſomething elſe; We muſt find ſomewhat or other, to paſs away the Time, till our <hi>Bridegroom comes:</hi> And ſo they fall into a ſlumber: As many, in Morality have diſcourſed the great degeneracy of humane nature, ſay they, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Life is Slumbred by the Animal Life; And, as ſome have deſired to <hi>Allegorize</hi> the Hiſtory of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve; Adam,</hi> when <hi>Eve was taken out of him, fell into a ſleep;</hi> you know, <hi>God cauſed a deep ſleep to fall upon Adam;</hi> And ſo (ſay they) that lower Soul came to have the Predominancy, and to get above, becauſe the Life of <hi>Adam</hi> was in a ſlumber, it was in a ſleep:</p>
                     <p>Give me leave by this to expreſs to you, my ſenſe in what I am now upon; as ſoon as ever the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41902:29"/> that the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> did not come: The lower Life began to get above, and the Chriſtians, even of the firſt Times, began to <hi>ſlumber</hi> and <hi>ſleep:</hi> We have many inſtances of it; <hi>Demas hath left us, having Loved the preſent World. Demas</hi> was not onely a ſingle Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; But he was a Peculiar Pattern of the State of Chriſtianity, <hi>Having Loved this preſent World;</hi> So ſays the Apoſtle, there is no Man <hi>like minded</hi> to <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> that <hi>naturally cares for your State: For all Men ſeek their own, not the things which are Jeſus Chriſt</hi>'s, Phil. 2. So I ſay, here was preſently a <hi>Slumbring</hi> of the Power of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.</p>
                     <p>And then, there's a Great Example of this Worldly Grandeur riſing, in that of <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> in the third Epiſtle of <hi>John</hi> ver. 9. <hi>He Loved to have the pre-Eminence.</hi> Now, as I ſaid of <hi>Demas,</hi> ſo I ſay of <hi>Diotrephes;</hi> It was not onely a ſingle Example, But the Biſhops of the Churches of Chriſt, began to <hi>Love Preeminency,</hi> to Love Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur; To Love Prelation, and to ſet up one above another: And thus the <hi>Apostacy</hi> began to creep in: And ſo Chriſtianity degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into a Worldly Intereſt, a Worldly Gain, a Worldly Greatneſs, a VVorldly State. And here the Life and Power of Chriſtianity <hi>fell aſleep;</hi> It was in a <hi>Slumber:</hi> And this Spirit went from one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and from <hi>hand to hand.</hi> And tho the <hi>Reformation</hi> amongſt us, hath made a great change among thoſe, that are called <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> yet, we are not awakened. The <hi>Bridegroom</hi> muſt be nearer his coming, before the Proteſtant Churches will awake.</p>
                     <p>And, beſides, you ſee, even to this day, that Men in the Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goſpel, in the ſeveral ways of Men, Make Chriſtianity a Point of Intereſt in the concernments of the preſent Life; I ſpeak not this, by way of Cenſure or Reproach, but to repreſent things plainly to you, how it is, and how it comes to paſs, that we are not more in haſte and earneſt for the coming of the <hi>Bridegroom.</hi> And then,</p>
                     <p>3. In the third Place; (And that indeed, which in part I have prevented my ſelfe in) the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> hath come to ſwallow up ſo great a part of Chriſtianity; Even ſo openly, and avowedly in all the <hi>Papal</hi> parts of the VVorld: And there are ſuch Roots, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders, and Twiggs, and Twines of it, about the <hi>Proteſtancy;</hi> That it cannot be, till Chriſt is nearer his <hi>coming,</hi> that the VVorld will be awakened to ſee the entry of his coming, Even the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant World,</hi> and the moſt profeſſing part of Chriſtianity.</p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:41902:29"/>
                     <p>I come now to the Second Head I propoſed: And that is, to open to you the Anſwers to the Objections, that may be made.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 1. <hi>You may ſay (in the firſt Place) If this be the tendency of ſuch a Diſcourſe, it ſeems a kind of Monkiſh ſuperſtition; a kind of Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone, and minding nothing in the World; it brings in a kind of a Pennance an Endurance, like that among the</hi> Papiſts; <hi>whereas the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeems to allow us a free Enjoyment of the World, and of the things of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Now, in Anſwer to this, I would onely ſay, that one ſort of extream is ready to ſwallow up another, if we do not take heed; A Man may remove ſo far from ſuch <hi>Ideas</hi> and <hi>Apprehenſions</hi> as theſe are, that he may fall into a perfect <hi>Worldlineſs,</hi> an Enjoyment of this VVorld: I dare not ſay any thing againſt a VViſe, and Sober, and Holy, and Temperate uſe of the things of this world, and a Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in our Places and in our Stations; But I ſay, we have every one of us great need to take heed; For, we tread upon the Brinks of danger, we tread upon the very Brinks of Deſtruction: And therefore, we ſhould walk with the greateſt VVarineſs, and with the greateſt Jealouſy; There is, undoubtedly, an allowance of theſe things. And yet for all that; Seeing it is ſuch a State of the world, as it is, (As I ſhall ſhew you preſently) we have Reaſon upon all Accounts, to deſire that it ſhould be at an End; Becauſe we walk ſo much upon Snares, and Temptations in the preſent State; Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, I don't ſay as they, take heed ye <hi>Touch not, Taſte not,</hi> nor come near to any of theſe things.</p>
                     <p>But this I am perſwaded, There are ſome Remains of the <hi>Purity of Chriſtianity,</hi> in that which ſuch perſons pretend to, though they have Debauch'd them: They have turned them into abominable Superſtition, and into Great and Deteſtable Idleneſs and Sloth, and to Horrible Impurity and Luxury, under the pretence of ſuch a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from the World. But yet ſtill (I ſay) at the firſt, there was ſome Vein of the Contempt of this World, and of Deſpiſing Things here below; In the Juſtice of God, leaving Men to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, This was corrupted into Hateful and Abominable Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is a Thing very Remarkable: You know there are thoſe that are called the <hi>Mendicants,</hi> or thoſe that go up and down, and profeſs nothing but Begging: But then, on the other ſide, There are no Courts ſo ſplendid in the World, as that of <hi>Cardinals, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> and <hi>Archbiſhops.</hi> So that it is a kind of Expedient, and Trick, to hold up the Pre-eminence of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> by a
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41902:30"/> ſeeming Contempt of the World, in the other part. I told you, Religion is neceſſary for this World, for the preſent ſtate of it; ſo the Beggery and Superſtition of thoſe that profeſs <hi>Poverty</hi> among the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> it is abſolutely neceſſary to uphold the Greatneſs and Splendor of the <hi>Court of Rome,</hi> and thoſe that depend upon it, on one ſide, by that Poverty on the other; For it ſeems to Cogg Men into a belief, that there's an excellency in the <hi>Popiſh Church,</hi> by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing in it ſuch an Example of Contempt of the World; Theſe are the <hi>Lying Wonders</hi> that are amongſt them, and fair preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by which they delude. But ſtill I ſay, tho we have loſt it, it cannot but be allowed, there ought to be now, and much more there ſhall be a State of the management of the preſent World, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſtianity, ſo as not to run into Superſtition; And yet to raiſe the Glory of Chriſt, and his Kingdom far above this World.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 2. I come to the Second Objection; <hi>How ſhall the World be maintained, if all were ſuch Earneſt Purſuers, and</hi> Haſters <hi>on to the</hi> Day of God, as now, what I have diſcours'd of, ſeems to lead to? <hi>Certainly Families would be at an End; all Buſineſs would ceaſe; and the maintaining of Kingdoms; of Laws and Rights of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; There would be an End of all Theſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Now therefore I ſay to you, If any Man have his Soul preſt upon the Kingdom of God, and the Coming of Chriſt, and the Coming of the <hi>Bridegroom;</hi> Let us conſider what an Anſwer Jeſus Chriſt gives, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 59. Chriſt had called one to <hi>follow</hi> him: Saith he, <hi>Whither ſhall I follow thee?</hi> I am willing to do it; where muſt I go? Saith Chriſt (Verſe 58.) <hi>Foxes have Holes, and Birds of the Air have Neſts; but the Son of Man hath not where to lay his Head:</hi> That is, you muſt not take care for this, where you ſhall have a Reſt, and whither you ſhall go; you muſt Reſign up All: But <hi>he ſaid, Lord, ſuffer me firſt to go and bury my Father. And Jeſus ſaid unto him, Let the dead bury their dead; but go thou and preach the Kingdom of God:</hi> That is, The Kingdom of God is of Greater Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, then even that which ſeems to be ſo great a peice of Piety, and Humanity, to Go, and bury a Father.</p>
                     <p>But you may ſtill urge, <hi>How great would the Inconvenience of this be, if Men ſhould do thus? How would there be any ſupport of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State of the World?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For that therefore I would refer you to another place, that is in the ſame <hi>Evangelist, Luke,</hi> Chap. 14. 16. <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven</hi>
                        <pb n="55" facs="tcp:41902:30"/> (ſaith he) <hi>is like unto a certain Man, that made a Great Supper, and bade many.</hi> That <hi>Supper</hi> is the Beginnings of Grace here, even to the <hi>Marriage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Supper of the Lamb.</hi> But <hi>they all with one conſent began to make excuſe: The firſt ſaid unto him, I have bought a peice of Ground;</hi> I am a Purchaſer; <hi>You muſt excuſe me from being ſo Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious;</hi> I am upon a Purchaſe. <hi>And another ſaid, I have bought five Yoke of Oxen, and I go to prove them; I pray thee have me excuſed:</hi> I am an Husbandman, and I cannot take care ſo of Religion: <hi>And another ſaid, I have married a Wife, and therefore I cannot come,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account. And in another Evangeliſt, <hi>They went to their Merchandiſe:</hi> I have a Great Trade, and I cannot carry on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State, if I mind ſo much the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay, The Purchaſing, and Husbandry, and Merchandiſe, and the Enjoyments of this World, and Relations, they are great Hinderances indeed, to the Glory of the Kingdom of Chriſt. But then,</p>
                     <p>The Second Thing I would ſay to you, which may give you Great Satisfaction as to this: If there were ſuch a <hi>Spirit poured out from on high;</hi> Don't think the World would be ſo Inconvenient by it; It would be brought into a more High, a Better, and more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent State; I am ſure, If <hi>the Spirit were ſo poured out upon the World;</hi> That Men did not excuſe themſelves from the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> by their Trade, Relations, and Families; And by their Intereſt in the preſent VVorld; I am ſure, that the <hi>Trees of the Wood would yeild forth of</hi> themſelves to us: The <hi>Hills would flow down with Milk,</hi> and the <hi>Mountains with Wine.</hi> VVhenever God will bring the VVorld into a Religious State indeed; Don't take care as if the State of the VVorld could not be upheld; For, it ſhall be upheld, and be more Happy and Bleſſed, than it is now, <hi>Joel 3. 18. And it ſhall come to paſs in that day, that the Mountains ſhall drop down New Wine, and the Hills ſhall flow down with Milk, and all the Rivers of</hi> Judah <hi>ſhall flow with Waters,</hi> &amp;c. Every thing ſhall be Happy and Proſperous; <hi>Inſtead of the Thorn ſhall come up the Fir Tree, and inſtead of the Bryar ſhall come up the Mirtle Tree, and it ſhall be to the Lord for a Name, and for a Memorial.</hi> When God comes to make the world truely Good, to bring in a Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, <hi>not in Word, but in Power;</hi> I ſay, when that comes to paſs, there ſhall be ſuch a ſtrange plenty to the World, ſuch a ſtrange Providence over the Creation: All that, which we take ſo much care about, and with ſo much Sin, and hatred, and envy one at
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41902:31"/> another; It will come ſo freely, there will be no need of diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of, and diſtracting our ſelves, or one another: When we come in High ſenſe to be the Servants of God, and to be in ſuch a State; All Creatures in Heaven, and Earth, would come, and lay down their Service at our Feet. <hi>The Heavens would hear the Earth, and the Earth would hear the Corn, and the Wine, and the Oyl; And they would hear Jezreel,</hi> Amos 9. 11. <hi>Behold, the days come, ſaith the Lord, that the Plowman ſhall overtake the Reaper, and the Treaders of Grapes him that ſoweth the Seed;</hi> That is, the Harveſt ſhall be ſooner than the very Plowing.</p>
                     <p>All Creatures, in Heaven and Earth, would offer themſelves to us: And all the Riches, that we dive for now, ſo deep into the Bowels of the Earth, and into the bottom of the <hi>Sea,</hi> they would come up, and be at our hand, in that Day, when the <hi>Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſhall be thus Univerſally upon the World, and when the <hi>Deſire of Nations ſhall come.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I would ſhut up this, in a very Brief Application to you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 1. In the Firſt Place; Let it move us ſeriouſly, to fill up our Religion with this Character of it; <hi>The Virgins went forth to meet the Bridegroom:</hi> There was the great mark in their Eye, the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in their Eye; Now, ask your ſelves, I beſeech you, is your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in <hi>meeting the Bridegroom?</hi> Is not your Praying, Morning and Evening, becauſe it is good Family-Order? It is a good thing for Reputation, and Credit: Is it not becauſe you are afraid, if you Riſe up and Lie down without Prayer, God won't Bleſs you that Day, nor give you good reſt that Night? He won't ſucceed you in your Calling; And in the Duties and Buſineſs of it? Is it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe natural Conſcience would cry out, and ſay, what! Do you live like a Heathen, yea a Brute, and like a Beaſt?</p>
                     <p>I acknowledge, theſe are valuable Reaſons in their kind. But ſure, there is a Higher, a Greater Reaſon to go forth to <hi>meet the Bridegroom;</hi> Becauſe, throughout all the Account, that can be given, why Men are Religious, if this be not Principal, if this be not the Supreme End, that I would <hi>meet the Bridegroom;</hi> It is not of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent True Alloy; Therefore Buoy up your Spirits, raiſe them, wind them up to this great height, I'll go forth <hi>to meet the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom.</hi> I pray this Morning, that I may <hi>meet</hi> with the <hi>Bridegroom;</hi> I go to hear this day, That I may <hi>meet with the Bridegroom:</hi> I would not have theſe great things wound up onely within the Circle of this Life, in this manner; Here comes Buſineſs, and here comes
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41902:31"/> Prayer; And ſo there's Sleep, and Eating, and Drinking; All comes in a Round, and we would have this Round always obſerved; And it calls to Publick Prayer, and to other of thoſe Duties: Now, if we turn about onely in this Circle, we run on Endleſsly about; But our care muſt be higher, <hi>Viz. To meet the Bridegroom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

                     <p>Is it that, which I believe in my Soul, enlightned by the Spirit of God, my Conſcience bearing me Witneſs in the Holy Ghoſt, that it will pleaſe <hi>the Bridegroom?</hi> Are my Thoughts, Affections, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Converſation ſuch?</p>
                     <p>And what reaſon have we, and do we Humble our ſelves before our <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> when we conſider this will not pleaſe; when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, this is not fine enough, Ornamental enough to his Glory, of value enough?

                     <p>But now conſider on the other ſide, You have the Name of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>City;</hi> And it is very admirable, And I cannot but propoſe my Obſervation to you, that God hath been pleaſed, very lately to cauſe me to conſider, and to obſerve; There is the Name of another <hi>City,</hi> I ſay; And it is the Name of the <hi>City</hi> of the <hi>Multitude.</hi> Ezek. 39. 17. <hi>The Name of that City ſhall be</hi> Hamonah. <hi>And they ſhall cleanſe the Land.

                     <p>As the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> hath its <hi>Gates,</hi> and an <hi>Angel</hi> before it; So the City here is the City of <hi>Deſtruction,</hi> as it is called, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 19.

                     </p>
                     <p>I have ſhewn you, that the very meaning of all Chriſtianity is a <hi>Going forth to meet the Bridegroom;</hi> And therefore, the preſent State, is a State of Eſpouſals, a State, wherein we are Contracted, and Affianced unto the Great <hi>Bridegroom;</hi> For, that the Eye of every Chriſtian, the great Aim and Deſign of thoſe that are <hi>Wiſe Virgins,</hi> is, that they may have a much higher Enjoyment of Chriſt, than they have now; And becauſe the Religion that is for the preſent World, and the preſent State, will not ſerve the great Intereſt and great purpoſe of our Immortal beings.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall now proceed to a fourth Doctrine, or Propoſition from theſe words.</p>

                        <hi>They went forth to meet the Bridegroom; And they that were ready, they went in with him to the Wedding.</hi> So, the Obſervation that I ſhall lay down to you, is this;</p>
                     <p>That all thoſe that are Chriſt's, they are to hold (according to the Scripture Expreſſion) they are to hold a <hi>Great Feaſt</hi> unto <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The great Intention, and meaning of the Goſpel, is to aſſure us, that after the Time of Preparation, and the Time of the <hi>Eſpouſals,</hi> there ſhall be a Glorious <hi>Feſtival;</hi> A Glorious Feaſt, <hi>The Marriage Supper of the Lamb;</hi> As you know it is called: And I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to open this to you, according to the Scripture-Light, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; And then, I ſhall compare it with all the Feaſts, that we read of in Scripture, under the Law; And ſo I ſhall come to make the Application of it, to our own State, and Condition.</p>
                     <p>Firſt therefore, to make it evident to you, that this is a great No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Scripture; That there is a <hi>Feaſt</hi> to be held; a <hi>Feaſt</hi> of Joy and Rejoycing, and of Happineſs, to be held to <hi>Jehovah.</hi> And it is this very <hi>Marriage-Supper</hi> (as you ſhall ſee) <hi>of the Lamb.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That the Scripture delights in this Repreſentation, is very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, by ſundry Great Expreſſions of it.</p>
                     <p>Iſaiah 25. 6, 7, 8. <hi>And in this Mountain ſhall the Lord of Hoſts make unto all People a Feaſt of Fat things, a Feaſt of Wines on the lees, of Fat things full of Marrow; Of Wines on the lees well refined. And he will deſtroy in this Mountain the Face of the covering caſt over all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the vail that is ſpread over all Nations; He will ſwallow up Death in victory, and the Lord God will wipe away Tears from off all Faces, and the rebuke of his People ſhall he take away from off all the Earth; For the Lord hath ſpoken it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is a great <hi>Feaſt</hi> that God will <hi>make to all People:</hi> And it is ſet out by ſuch Kind of Reſemblances and Similitudes, as expreſs a Great, and a Plentiful, and a Rich, and a moſt Delicious Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among Men; <hi>Fat things full of Marrow; And Wines on the Lees well refined.

Are there not great Tracts of the World that are not known? And do not the <hi>Jews,</hi> that have the Doctrine of the Scriptures in the <hi>Old Teſtament;</hi> Do they not deny Chriſt? All theſe things (that I may ſpeak in a Familiar phraſe) Chriſtianity is twitted with, upbraided, reproached with. But in the day of that <hi>Feaſt;</hi> All the Darkneſs of that State ſhall be drawn off. In all our Feaſts now there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary a ſenſe of Death. As I remember, the great Prince <hi>Philip of Macedon,</hi> when he had the moſt Sumptuous and Magnificent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment; He had firſt of all a Deaths Head ſerved up, in the Beginning of the Feaſt: As if he ſhould ſay, tho I have entertained you now, like a Prince, and with all the Imaginable Royalty that you can expect; Yet now after all this; I and you muſt Dye. So ſhould we do, in all our Eating and Drinking, if we do but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, we do but onely feed (as we have a Phraſe) we do but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feed Death; We do but pamper Bodies, to make a Feaſt for the Worms.</p>
                     <p>Now (ſaith the Lord) in this Feaſt I will take away all Tears, and Shame, and Reproach from all People, utterly take it off. O therefore! VVho would not Aim, and Deſign this, to be at this great Feaſt, that muſt be held to <hi>Jehovah?</hi> And that he himſelf will hold for all his People, as the great Prince and Maſter, and Lord of it:</p>
                     <p>So you know, there is nothing more ordinary in the Goſpel, than to compare the State of Things to a great Supper, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. He deſcribes the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> by ſuch a <hi>Supper,</hi> as this. <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is like unto a certain King, which made a Marriage for his Son, and he ſent forth his Servants to call them that were bidden to the Wedding: And they would not come; Again, he ſent forth other Servants, ſaying, Tell them which are bidden, behold, I have prepared my Dinner: My Oxen and my Fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: Come unto the Marriage; But they made light of it: And when the King came in to ſee the guests, he ſaw there a Man, which had not on a Wedding-Garment.</hi> (Ver. 11. 12.) As I ſhall after endeavour to enforce in the Application. But you ſee plainly, that it is a great <hi>Nuptial Feaſt,</hi> that the Glory of the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> is Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by: So it is ſaid, His Servants wait for him: There is a place of great moment to what we are upon, that is Diſ-advantagiouſly
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41902:34"/> Tranſlated: And therefore I would deſire that you would take ſomething the more Notice of it, <hi>Matth. 13. 34. The Son of Man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is as a Man taking a far Journey, who left his Houſe, and gave Authority to his Servants, and to every Man his Work, and Commanded the Porter to watch: Watch ye therefore, for ye know not when the Maſter of the Houſe cometh.</hi> And this, in <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. It is called, a <hi>coming</hi> becauſe of the <hi>Wedding,</hi> ver 46. That's the Expreſſion I would deſire a little that you would take Notice of; <hi>And ye your ſelves like unto Men that wait for the Lord, when he will return from the Wedding;</hi> VVe Tranſlate. But the word in the <hi>Greek</hi> will very well ſignifie, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Wedding,</hi> or upon the Account of the <hi>Wedding.</hi> When Chriſt comes; He comes becauſe, or upon the Account of the <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:</hi> And that he may be preſent at that great <hi>Feaſt,</hi> that is to be held unto the Lord our God.

                     <p>In the Second Place, I ſhall give you a brief Parallel between all the Feaſts that were appointed to the Servants and People of God, in the Old Teſtament; and this Great Feaſt that is to be held to <hi>Jehovah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To give you therefore the Senſe, and the Meaning of it, in theſe Two Expreſſions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is a Time of the Greateſt Solemnity, Glory, and Luſtre, and Splendor, and Joy, and Bleſſedneſs, that the Creation ever knew, or can know, in the State of a Creation. I ſay, it is a State, or a Time of the greateſt Magnificence, of the greateſt Joy and Enjoyment, that ever was known in the whole Creation; nothing
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41902:34"/> ever like to that. Alas! the Days that we now know here in the World; take thoſe that have been the moſt Lightſome, the moſt Proſperous, they are all Dark, and Gloomy, and Cloudy Days, in compariſon of that Day, of the Great Glory, and the Great Feſtival that he ſpeaks of.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, it is very deſirable to find the Hearts of any poſſeſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly with God, and with Religion, and with Holineſs, and with Chriſtianity, and with Communion with God, and Enjoyment of him, according to the preſent State of Things. But, if we did but know, how low the Condition is now, wherein we are; If we did but conſider, what a Dark, Black Cloud there hangs over all; a Cloud of Corruption, a Cloud of Unhappineſs, a Cloud of Sorrow and Affliction, it is they live in; And it comes upon the moſt Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Servants of God; you know, in what a Cloud they are wrapt up, as to all bodily Appearance, when they come to Die; and what a Cloud of Corruption hovers over them; For, take the moſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Preachers, and the moſt Holy Men, if you could follow them into all the Retirements of their Thoughts and Ways, you would ſee, that there is a Deadneſs, there is an Emptineſs of God; There is a Low State, wherein they now are; ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Surely, there is ſome Divine purpoſe (tho we may not eaſily find it), VVhy the Divine Spirit of God makes ſo great the <hi>Feaſt</hi> and <hi>Preparation</hi> of <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> Eſther 1. 1. <hi>Ahaſuerus, which Reigned from</hi> India, <hi>even unto</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>over an Hundred, and Seven and Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Provinces.

                     <p>For, Indeed, thoſe four Monarchies, tho they have kept the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt</hi> thus long, from its Glory, and from its Appearance, yet there was ſome kind of <hi>Image,</hi> and <hi>Repreſentation</hi> of the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ in them:</hi> And, it is very obſervable, that the <hi>Perſian Monarchs,</hi> above all others, Were greatly ſerviceable to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, the <hi>Type</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt.</hi> And ſo, God choſe, I am perſwaded (I will not engage far in it) this great <hi>Feaſt of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haſuerus,</hi> with ſuch a care of Sobriety: And it was given to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the Glory, and Riches, and Magnificence (in a Spiritual ſenſe) wherein the <hi>Marriage Supper of the Lamb ſhall be held.</hi> So I ſay, All is a ſignification of that Life, of that Light, of that Glory, of that Bleſſedneſs, of that Holineſs, of that Purity, that ſhall be in the <hi>Kingdom of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It Repreſents that exceeding Joy; As it is ſaid, in <hi>Pſalm 16. Thou wilt ſhew me the Path of Life: In thy preſence is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fullneſs of Joy; And at thy Right Hand there are Pleaſures for evermore.</hi> Indeed, it is firſt applyed to Chriſt, and in him, to all His: <hi>Thou wilt not leave my Soul in Hell, neither wilt thou ſuffer thy Holy one to ſee Corruption.</hi> For, at this time, <hi>The Lord our God ſhall come, and all his Saints with him;</hi> All his <hi>Dead Saints</hi> ſhall be raiſed to this great <hi>Feaſt; He will not leave their Souls in Hell, nor ſuffer his Holy ones to ſee Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He'll ſwallow up Death in Victory.</hi> In that <hi>Feaſt, he'll ſhew them the Path of Life:</hi> And the Entertainment of that <hi>Feaſt, is fullneſs of Joy,</hi> and <hi>Pleaſures for evermore.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And ſo, in that Place of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> I read to you; Where <hi>God w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>es Tears from all Faces; And the reproach and rebuke of his People he ſhall take off.</hi> All the Glory of the whole Creation of God, and of his mighty Power in it is made uſe of to ſet forth a viſible State of Joy, and Glory; It ſhall be on purpoſe brought out for that day, for the Glory, and for the Honour of that <hi>Feaſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. In the Second Place; Hereby is ſignified to us, that even this <hi>Feſtival,</hi> it is but for an appointed Time. It is for a Limited Time: In regard of the manner of it, in regard of the viſibility of it; As it is a thing to be ſeen, ſo it is for a Limited Time: For, it is received into abſolute Eternity, <hi>And the Kingdom is delivered up.</hi>
                        <pb n="65" facs="tcp:41902:35"/> (As the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>to God, and to the Father.</hi> It is for a Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Time; and it is in Preparation to that Union with God, to all Eternity. And therefore it is Repreſented to us, by a <hi>Thouſand Years,</hi> It is a Feaſt of a <hi>Thouſand Years.</hi> As <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> held a <hi>Feaſt of One Hundred and Fourſcore Days;</hi> Jehovah for Jeſus Chriſt his Son, (for the <hi>Nuptials</hi> betwixt him and his Church) holds a <hi>Feaſt of a Thouſand Years;</hi> And when that is at an End, Then (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. (That moſt Notable Place of Scripture, that I have ſo often endeavoured to Imprint the Senſe of upon you) <hi>Then cometh the End</hi> (Verſe 24.) <hi>when he ſhall have deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the Kingdom to God, even the Father, when he ſhall have put down all Rule, and all Authority and Power. And</hi> (Then, Verſe 28.) <hi>when all things ſhall be ſubdued unto him, then ſhall the Son alſo himſelf be ſubject unto him, that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So, I ſay, It is a Limited Time; Even though That be a Great Time, and it is called a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> that <hi>never ends,</hi> becauſe the Glory does not go off; But, as when the <hi>Nuptial Feaſt</hi> is over, Perſons of Great Condition, and of Princely Eſtate, you know, They are ſtill in Glory and ſtill in Luſtre; though it be in a more ſetled State. So Chriſt, and all his Saints, they are in a perpetual Joy, in perpetual Happineſs, that does not end: But only the Glory and Magnificence of the Wedding and Nuptials ends.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall now endeavour to parallel to you the <hi>Feaſts of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament;</hi> and to ſhew you, That the Spiritual Senſe, and the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Meaning of them, is, This Great Solemnity of the <hi>Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> That you may know therefore, That thoſe <hi>Feaſts</hi> that we read of in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> are truely, and indeed the Emblems and the Figures, and the Types, and the Shadows of Spiritual Things; Even of this Great <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt: I ſhall give you that Standard of Scripture, that ought to be a Rule to us, in all things, concerning the Types of <hi>the Old Teſtament.</hi> Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.

The <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> ſhall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately come in, as ſoon as God hath removed the preſent Time, the Time now preſſing againſt it, The Kingdom of Chriſt will flow in a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> main: As when the <hi>Flood-Gates</hi> are drawn up, when that which is as the Bar in the way, is taken away, immediately, like a great Torrent, the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Chriſt will <hi>come in.</hi> When <hi>time ſhall be no more;</hi> that is, ſuch a time, as hitherto hath preſs'd againſt that Kingdom, tho' in the mean Time It is made Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and leads to it; But that is a note, rather by the way. The Thing that I chiefly intend is, that all things in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> were but <hi>Figures</hi> and <hi>Types</hi> of <hi>things that were to come.</hi> I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore give you a Brief Compare: For, I will be as ſhort in it, as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſibly I can: You ſhall find, that one Great Branch of the Religion of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the Worſhip of God in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> one great Branch of it was the <hi>holding</hi> of ſo many <hi>Feaſts</hi> in a Year to the Lord. The 23d. of <hi>Leviticus</hi> does give us a Deſcription of all thoſe <hi>Feaſts:</hi> And, I ſhall (as I ſay) in Brief, compare them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> There was the <hi>Feaſt</hi> of <hi>every Week,</hi> which was the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> the <hi>Jewiſh Sabbath,</hi> the <hi>Seventh Day;</hi> And ſo the <hi>Seventh Year;</hi> and the <hi>Seven Seventh Year,</hi> that is, which made up a <hi>Seven of Seven Weeks, of Years.</hi> All this, there was obſerv'd in the Time of the Law. There is that which we now call the <hi>Lords Day;</hi> It was then the <hi>Seventh Day</hi> of the <hi>Week,</hi> the <hi>Jewiſh Sabbath:</hi> That was a
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41902:36"/> 
                        <hi>Weekly Revolution,</hi> and then, every <hi>Seventh Year</hi> was a <hi>Sabbatical Year.</hi> And then, after <hi>Seven Sevens of Years,</hi> there was the <hi>Jubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee,</hi> every <hi>Fiftieth Year.</hi> Now, all this was a Figure of that Great <hi>Sabbatiſm,</hi> that <hi>remains to the People of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So the <hi>Seventh,</hi> both <hi>Day,</hi> and <hi>Year,</hi> and the Seventh of Seven Years, the Seventh of Seven Weeks, or Weeks of Years; that is, after every Forty nine Years, which is Seven Sevens; you know, the Fiftieth Year was a Year of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> and Holy to the Lord; A Feaſt of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> of <hi>Great Freedom,</hi> of <hi>Great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> of <hi>Great ſetting free,</hi> both the Perſons and Eſtates of Men; and all was to repreſent what the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 9. There <hi>remaineth, &amp;c. He went through all kind of Reſts, that were under the Law;</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 9. Yet beyond all, <hi>There remaineth a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batiſm,</hi> a <hi>Great Sabbatiſing to the People of God.</hi> So that this is the <hi>Great Sabbatiſm,</hi> that ſhall be <hi>held</hi> to God; It ſhall be in theſe <hi>Thouſand Years:</hi> That's the State of <hi>perfect Sabbatiſm</hi> wherein Perſons ſhall not <hi>ſpeak their own Words, think their own Thoughts,</hi> nor <hi>do their own Actions,</hi> but ſhall be the <hi>Servants of God, and of Chriſt,</hi> with <hi>His Name upon their Foreheads.</hi> Conſider therefore this Expreſſion of the Apoſtle, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. indeed we Tranſlate it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (which is Great Pity, that it ſhould be ſo Diſadvantageouſly Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated) <hi>There remains a Reſt;</hi> ſo we ſay. But the <hi>Margin</hi> being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible (as it were) that They did wrong, in calling it only a <hi>Reſt,</hi> gives the Higher Style of <hi>keeping a Sabbath;</hi> not only ſuch a <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> kept, nor ſuch a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as <hi>Chriſtians</hi> keep; but beyond all this, there Remains the Bleſſed <hi>Festival</hi> of a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> in which we ſhall be free from all the Cumber, both of Worldly Buſineſs, and alſo of Corruption, and Miſery, and Unhappineſs. This ſhall be the Great <hi>Sabbatiſm</hi> of the Great <hi>Nuptials</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Great <hi>Nuptials</hi> of the <hi>Lamb.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. In the ſecond place, There was the Great <hi>Feaſt</hi> of <hi>Paſſeover:</hi> which was upon the Deliverance from the <hi>Bondage of Egypt.</hi> I will not ſpend any time to particularize it; you ſhall find, there was the <hi>Feaſt of Paſſeover;</hi> of which, we read abundantly, in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. And after the <hi>Paſſeover</hi> was ſlain, there was the <hi>Offering of the firſt fruits.</hi> I'll give you a Brief Account of all, according to the <hi>New Teſtament:</hi> There is to be the Higheſt <hi>Paſſeover</hi> of that <hi>Feſtival,</hi> that is, A full Table of the <hi>Redemption of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> A feaſting on the <hi>Paſcal Lamb;</hi> the <hi>Redemption of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. For Chriſt our Paſſeover is ſacrificed for us,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks; And in the <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> when Chriſt had ordain'd the <hi>Supper of the Lord;</hi> even
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41902:37"/> after the ordaining of it. This <hi>Paſſeover</hi> ſhall be <hi>fulfilled in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> As he ſaid of that <hi>Fruit of the Vine,</hi> He would drink it <hi>new with them in the Kingdom of the Father.</hi> So he ſaith in the Evangeliſt <hi>Luke; This Paſſeover ſhall be fulfilled in the Kingdom of God.</hi> That is, When we ſhall have the full Enjoyment of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in his <hi>Redemption.</hi> For then the <hi>Paſchal Lamb</hi> ſhall be ſet out to us in the Fullneſs of its Effect; in the Fullneſs and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of His <hi>Redemption;</hi> As He gave Himſelf a <hi>Lamb</hi> without Spot, <hi>Sacrificed</hi> to God for us. That is, the Great Senſe of our Saviour in thoſe Words, <hi>This Paſſeover ſhall be fulfilled in the Kingdom of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> For the <hi>Feaſt of the Firſt Fruits;</hi> You know, In two Regards, we may ſay, That it is a <hi>Feaſt of the firſt Fruits,</hi> or the <hi>Sheaf offered,</hi> both in regard of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and alſo in regard of our ſelves: In regard of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> It is ſaid, in the 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 23. Chriſt the Firſt Fruits,</hi> and <hi>they that are Chriſt's at his Coming; Every Man in his own Order, Chriſt the Firſt Fruits,</hi> and <hi>they that are Chriſt's, at his Coming.</hi> Then ſhall that Bleſſed <hi>Firſt Fruits,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, the <hi>Firſt-born of every Creature; The Firſt Begotten from the Dead,</hi> He ſhall come forth in Glory of His <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and in the Glory of His <hi>Appearance.</hi> It is a Feaſt of the <hi>Firſt Fruits,</hi> becauſe then <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is the <hi>firſt Fruits,</hi> comes forth in all His Glory, and in all His Bleſſedneſs. And, that it is the <hi>Feaſt of firſt Fruits,</hi> in regard of his Servants; I ſhall give you two Scriptures, and ſo paſs off, <hi>James 1. 18. Of his own will begat he us with the Word of Truth, that we ſhould be a kind of firſt Fruits of his Creatures;</hi> And, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 4. Theſe, (ſaith he, ſpeaking of the <hi>Hundred forty and four Thouſand that were Sealed) Theſe are the firſt Fruits to God, and to the Lamb.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. The fourth Feaſt, that we read of; It was the <hi>Feaſt</hi> of <hi>Weeks;</hi> As it is called in that, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. And it was after ſeven compleat Sabbaths were paſt; Then there was a <hi>Feaſt,</hi> which is called <hi>Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt:</hi> And at that very <hi>Feaſt,</hi> was the great pouring <hi>Out of the Spirit of Chriſt upon the Diſciples, Acts</hi> 2. 1. And ſo there ſhall be the <hi>Feaſt</hi> of the <hi>Harveſt,</hi> of all the Servants of God, gathered in one after the <hi>Pouring out of that bleſſed Spirit of God.</hi> All this ſhall be much greater than that was in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. This was but a Beginning; It was but an Entrance of that which is to be done at the <hi>Feast of the Great Harveſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Surely, never was there ſuch a <hi>Feast of Pentecoſt;</hi> Such a <hi>Feaſt of Weeks,</hi> as ſhall be then; Every one, who ſhall be admitted to that Feaſt,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41902:37"/> His mouth ſhall be <hi>Full of the Wonderful works of God.</hi> He ſhall ſpeak abundantly of the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> and of Jeſus Chriſt, and of the Riches of Grace; He ſhall ſpeak abundantly of the mighty Works of God, in that mighty <hi>Pouring out of the Spirit of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. In the Fifth Place; There ſhall be the <hi>Feaſt of Trumpets:</hi> As we read, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. After the <hi>Feaſt of Weeks,</hi> was the <hi>Feast of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets.</hi> And that Feaſt was a Type of the <hi>Seven Trumpets</hi> in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> ending and fill'd up in the <hi>Seventh Trumpet</hi> that we read of, <hi>Rev. 11. The Seventh Angel ſounded, and immediately there were loud Voices in Heaven, ſaying, the Kingdoms of this World are become the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of His Chriſt, and he ſhall Reign for ever and ever.</hi> ver. 15. With which you may compare what is ſpoken in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 52. And in 1 <hi>Theſ. 4. 16. Chriſt ſhall deſcend, the Trumpet ſhall ſound, and the Dead ſhall be raiſed Incorruptible. And the Saints ſhall be changed. And he ſhall come down with the Shout and Voice of the Arch-angel, and with the Trampet of God.</hi> Then ſhall that great <hi>Trumpet ſound;</hi> And then ſhall be the <hi>Feaſt</hi> when all the Dead in Chriſt, and they that have <hi>ſlept In,</hi> and <hi>By Jeſus,</hi> ſhall ariſe, and ſhall appear in Glory, and ſhall ſtand forth in that State of an Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> And then is the Bleſſedneſs of the <hi>Saints chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, who live and remain here upon Earth.</hi> And here all the forenam'd <hi>Feaſts</hi> are together united in one.</p>
                     <p>6. In the Sixth Place; There ſhall be <hi>the Day of Attonement,</hi> the Day of the great <hi>Attonement.</hi> As we read, of that alſo: A Day; wherein God was reconciled, wherein the Entrances into the <hi>Holy of Holies were opened;</hi> All that was to be in the <hi>Day of Attonement.</hi> And ſo there ſhall be in the State of the <hi>Wedding of Chriſt; The Feaſt of Attonement, of Reconciliation,</hi> As the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Acts 3. 19. When the times of Refreſhing and of Reſtitution ſhall come. Repent ye therefore, and be Convented, that your Sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord:</hi> In that Great <hi>Day of Attonement,</hi> and at the <hi>Great Wedding,</hi> All that make up the <hi>Lambs Wife</hi> ſhall meet there, if they have been Enemies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to God and Chriſt, they ſhall be Atton'd: They'll lay aſide their Enmity one to another, and fall into mutual Kindneſs, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment one of another: Then, all things, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Col. 1. All things in Heaven and in Earth</hi> ſhall be fully Reconciled by Him, <hi>Even by Him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. The laſt is, <hi>The Feaſt of Tabernacles;</hi> The Feaſt of a <hi>Paradiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acal-State. The Feaſt of Tabernacles, The Feaſt of Goodly Boughs of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41902:38"/> Olives, and Palms,</hi> And whatſoever was moſt valuable among the Plants, was brought out <hi>to make Boughs with, at that time.</hi> And to this the great <hi>Feast of the Kingdom of Chriſt is compared;</hi> Becauſe it ſhall be the State of <hi>Paradice</hi> Reſtored: All the Glory, and Beauty, and Excellency of the Creation, ſhall then be reſtored. We read, therefore, <hi>Zech. 14. 16, &amp;c.</hi> of this Happy and Bleſſed <hi>Feaſt of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles:</hi> It is when <hi>all ſhall be Holineſs to</hi> Jehovah. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, that every one that is left of all the Nations which come againſt</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>ſhall even go up from Year to Year, to Worſhip the King, the Lord of Hoſts, and to keep the Feaſt of Tabernacles.</hi> It is the Feaſt of that State of Paradice, where, <hi>Inſtead of Briars, and Thorns, ſhall come up the Fir-Tree, and the Mirtle-Tree. And it ſhall be to the Lord for a Name, and for a Perpetual Remembrance.</hi> Eſay 55. 13.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall now Briefly ſhut up all this, in Application. And I deſire you, that you would refreſh theſe things in your own Thoughts; And that you would bring them to mind: You will find every particular <hi>Feaſt,</hi> that of the <hi>Paſsover, Exod.</hi> 12. You'll find at large; and every other Feaſt in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. And, I deſire you would conſider, and read that Chapter; And remember, that the Glory, and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and Bleſſedneſs, and Spirituality of thoſe Feaſts ſhall be in the <hi>Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 1. The firſt uſe therefore that I would make of it, ſhall be this; To make a preſent Invitation to you to this Great Feaſt, that is to be held to the Lord our God; Even to <hi>Jehovah:</hi> That you would mind this; That you would ſeriouſly mind it, and conſider it, that all of us are now Invited. For now, when we may go (as in that, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.)

                     <p>Behold, this Sermon, and this Diſcourſe, this Preaching of the Goſpel, it is ſent to you, to invite you to this great <hi>Supper: He ſent forth his Servants,</hi> (ver. 3.) That is, the Miniſters and Preachers of the Goſpel, the Expounders and Openers of Scripture to you, to call you, and to bid you unto this <hi>Wedding.</hi> Now take heed! Take heed!

Behold, thou art <hi>Bidden to the Marriage-Supper of the Lamb:</hi> Thou art invited to that Great Feaſt of the <hi>Kings Son:</hi> Thou art earneſtly perſwaded, that thou wouldeſt be preſent there, and that thou wouldeſt partake of the Splendor, Glory, and Magnificence, and of the Happineſs of that Day: Take heed now, that thou don't make <hi>Light of it,</hi> and ſay, what's this to me?

And, if any ſhould ſay, this is nothing but onely a Noiſe of Words, and of Diſcourſe; ſaith God (<hi>ver. 9.) As the Heavens are higher than the Earth, ſo are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. For as the Rain cometh down, and the Snow from Heaven, and returneth not thither, but Watereth the Earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give Seed to the Sower, and Bread to the Eater; So ſhall my word be that goeth out of my Mouth; It ſhall not return unto me void, but it ſhall accompliſh that which I pleaſe, and it ſhall Proſper in the thing whereto I ſent it:</hi> Therefore, aſſure your ſelves, that this

                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 2. In the Second Place, I ſhall point out to you, how you may prepare your ſelves: You muſt take care of this;</p>
                     <p>Firſt of all, that you get a <hi>Wedding-Garment.</hi> As it is ſaid, <hi>Mat. 22. He ſaw one there, that had not on a Wedding-Garment. And he ſaid unto him, Friend, how cameſt thou in hither, not having a Wedding Garment? And he was ſpeechleſs.</hi> The Man was ſo confounded, he was ſo aſhamed of the thing, that he had nothing at all to ſay. <hi>The King came in to ſee his Gueſts, and he ſaw a Man that had not on a Wedding Garment;</hi> The Man had nothing to ſay, he knew there was no Reaſon for him to ſay any thing. And what is this <hi>Wedding Garment?</hi> It is an intereſt in Chriſt, an Intereſt in His Righteouſneſs, a being Cloathed in <hi>Linnen, White, and Pure, waſhed in the Blood of the Lamb.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And tho the Perſon did not deſpiſe the <hi>Wedding,</hi> He made a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, as we do, of Chriſtianity, to come to it: Yet in the next verſe (<hi>ver. 13.) The King ſaid to his Servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and caſt him into outer Darkneſs; And There ſhall be Weeping, and Gnaſhing of Teeth; For, many are called, but few are choſen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore, look diligently to this thing; That tho you ſeem to ſpeak fair, you will come, and you will be there, and you do make a pretence; And yet you have not the <hi>Wedding Garment,</hi> Chriſt, and his Righteouſneſs; Oh, how ſad will it be!</p>
                     <p>In the Second Place; You muſt look diligently to this too; That you have <hi>Oyl in your Veſſels,</hi> and not onely <hi>in your Lamps.</hi> This you ſee, is in <hi>Matth. 25. The Fooliſh Virgins never thought of Oyl in their Veſſels, but onely in their Lamps.</hi> That is, you muſt have Grace, you muſt have a Holy and Spiritual Life from Chriſt. That will be able to laſt out, and to endure that very Time. But I ſhall not ſpeak more of it; Becauſe I ſhall come in a full Diſcourſe to Treat of it.</p>

The third uſe I would have you make, is, I would have you obſerve, and conſider but a little, How this Notion of a Feaſt, hath been Corrupted, by the <hi>Anti-chriſtian World;</hi> What a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Feaſts have there been, of Man's Inſtitution? The Feaſt of ſuch a Saint, and ſuch a Saint; and Feaſts that never were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41902:39"/> by God; Yet they have come into uſe, and they remain in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation: And how came this?</p>
                     <p>It is by that Counterfeit Chriſtianity, <hi>Antichriſtianiſm</hi> came in, Feaſts that never were ordain'd by God. And, I wiſh, with all my heart, there were not Reaſon to bewail, not the <hi>Anti-chriſtian</hi> World onely, but even our <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Profeſſion: There's nothing looks more Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, and more Strange, than ſetting up <hi>Feaſts,</hi> that the Goſpel never appointed, nor Inſtituted; I ſay, I pray with all my heart, that they that have Power and Authority in theſe things may conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it. For, when <hi>Jereboam departed from the purity of Religion,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by God, in the Old Teſtament; He made <hi>Feaſts,</hi> and <hi>Times</hi> of his own.</p>
                     <p>So the Chriſtian World hath done: And the Rellicks, and Refuſe of it are ſtill among us: We keep up Times that never were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, That there's no mention, nor Signature of, in the Goſpel. I do not ſpeak any way, to deſire to Reflect, or to be Cenſorious, but to ſpeak the Truth of things, according to the Word of God: For, it is onely of <hi>Jehovah</hi> himſelf, to appoint his own <hi>Feaſts.</hi> And He hath kept up to us <hi>The Feast</hi> of the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> and the <hi>Feaſt</hi> of the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> as Preparatory to that Great <hi>Feſtival</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt:</hi> And no other are we to make, nor to Deviſe, of our own Hearts.</p>
                     <p>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 4. The Fourth, and Laſt Application is this;</p>
                     <p>That you would ſeriouſly conſider this <hi>Marriage</hi> of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> this Great <hi>Feaſt,</hi> how near it is. For, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were mighty careful to keep Account of Days, and the Motion of Times, and Weeks; They were to Account (as Scripture-Expreſſion is, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 15. In that Caſe) ſo we ought to Account the Time.</p>
                     <p>And, methinks, it is a very great Amazement, and a very great Sadneſs; That there ſhould be no more Diligence nor Care, Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Publick Miniſtry of the Goſpel, nor in Private Chriſtians, to Count the Time, and to know how near it is to this Great <hi>Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val:</hi> For, tho you may think you are Excuſed, Becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>Watch, For ye know not the Time;</hi> Yet I ſhall ſhew you, That hath quite another ſenſe; And that it ſpeaks, that every one ſhould look, that they have the Truth of Grace, and <hi>Oyl in the Veſſel,</hi> and the <hi>Wedding Garment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the <hi>Watchfulneſs,</hi> that the Spirit of God confines us to. But, in the mean time, we ought to be upon our <hi>Watch-Tower,</hi> and to <hi>know the Times</hi> appointed by God; For, it is great Hypocriſie,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41902:40"/> (However we may think it Great Modeſty) that we do not <hi>Diſcern the Signs of the Times;</hi> To be Inſtructed in the Times, from the Signs the Scripture hath given us, from Time to Time: That we may come to know, when this Great <hi>Coming of the Kingdom of Christ ſhall be;</hi> And that our Hearts may be greatly preparing, and in a Readineſs for that <hi>Great Day,</hi> &amp;c. is one Branch of the great Duty of <hi>Waiting for his Appearance.</hi>

                     <p>I have, you know, in this <hi>Parable,</hi> ſhewn you the Great Intention of it; That it Repreſents the Glory of that <hi>Nuptial</hi> Feaſt, That <hi>Wedding,</hi> That Marriage of <hi>the Lamb.</hi> And I have already opened the ſeveral Preparatory Particulars in it.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall now at this Time Diſcourſe upon what I have propoſed; <hi>The Bridegroom Tarried;</hi> And, ſo I ſhall endeavour to lay this Foundation,</p>
                     <p>That the coming of Jeſus Chriſt hath not been, ſince He ſpoke this <hi>Parable,</hi> Neither is it yet immediately to be. The <hi>Bridegroom Tarried.</hi> And therefore, herein I ſhall endeavour to open to you,</p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:41902:40"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> How ſtrange it is, according to Scripture-Diſcourſe, that the coming of Chriſt has been ſo long delay'd.</p>
                     <p>And, I ſhall Anſwer to you, the Objections that ariſe from it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Truth of Scripture, concerning the <hi>Bridegroom's coming;</hi> And ſo how this delay, and many Scriptures can be reconciled.</p>
                     <p>In the Second Place, I ſhall give you the two Great Reaſons, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, why the <hi>Bridegroom's coming is Delay'd.</hi> And then,</p>
                     <p>In the Third Place, I ſhall enquire the Signs, when this <hi>Tarrying</hi> of the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> is like to be at an End.</p>
                     <p>And, I ſhall endeavour ſo to Diſcourſe this, as to reſolve you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Preſent Face of the World; That we are in a Time, you know all very well, of very great <hi>Commotions</hi> of the Nations, and as the Scripture Expreſſion is: We hear of <hi>Wars,</hi> and <hi>Rumours of Wars</hi> continually: And, you know, God hath, both in other Nations, and in a part of this Nation (the beyond the <hi>Sea.</hi>) given us Great Reaſon to conſider that ſhaking of the Earth, that was ſo dreadful in a part of our Nation, tho beyond the <hi>Sea;</hi> And that gentle Admonition, that he hath given us of it, ſo lately, in this very place, In this very City; I would therefore Diſcourſe that point to you, how far we may look upon theſe, as Signs of the near <hi>Coming of the Bridegroom.</hi> And then, I ſhall cloſe up the whole, in the Application of it.</p>
                     <p>I begin with the Firſt: And that is, to Diſcourſe to you, how ſtrange it may ſeem, and diſagreeable to Scripture, that the <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom</hi> hath ſo long <hi>Delayed his Coming;</hi> And I ſhall remove the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectons againſt the Truth and Verity of <hi>Scripture, Notwithſtanding</hi> the Delay of the coming.</p>
                     <p>Firſt therefore, it ſeems very ſtrange, that ſuch an Evil State of the World ſhould continue beyond the Death and Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt; Seeing there is ſuch an Infinite Grace of God in a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and that he pleaſed <hi>to give his own Son to Lost Man, That whoever believes in him, ſhould not periſh, bat have Eternal Life,</hi> It is no wonder, we may be ready truly to ſay, That the World continued till Chriſt came, till He Dyed, and Roſe again, and till there was an Univerſal Preaching of the Goſpel in His Name: But why ſhould it laſt any longer? So Great a Thing was done Then in the World, that there can be no Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch another. And therefore ſure there was nothing now to do, but for Chriſt to have a Kingdom, as Great, and as Large, and as Glorious, as the Scripture aſſures he ſhall have.</p>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:41902:41"/>
                     <p>For, as I have noted to you; and I deſire that you would bear (as I have ſaid before) That Scripture in your Mind, <hi>Gal. 4. 4. When the Fullneſs of Time was come, God ſent forth his Son.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is no wonder that Time ſhould laſt, till <hi>The Fullneſs of Time came:</hi> But that it ſhould laſt beyond, is very ſtrange; <hi>God ſent forth his Son, made of a Woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law, that we might receive the Adoption of Children. And God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son to all thoſe that are his Children, to cry, Abba, Father.</hi> Theſe were ſo Great Things, that till this <hi>Fullneſs,</hi> indeed, it is no Wonder at all, that God bore up the World; becauſe he had ſuch a Great Diſcovery of his Love, and of his Grace, to make; and by which Men had been Saved all along before, even the <hi>Fathers</hi> in the <hi>Old Teſtament:</hi> And by which, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is to be alone expected and received. 'Twas no Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therefore, (I ſay) that God bore up the World to that <hi>Full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Time.</hi> But now, it is ſtrange, that it ſhould laſt any longer than that: It is Wonder there has not been a Kingdom of Redemption, and of Glory ever ſince.</p>
                     <p>But now, to Anſwer you in that Particular, and by a Place of Scripture, as Notable as <hi>this Fullneſs of Time is.</hi> There is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other far Greater Appearance of the Glory of the Redemption of Chriſt; For you know, All That was in Humiliation; It was in an <hi>Incognito</hi>-State, in a Diſguiſe of the <hi>Son of God, Humbling Himſelf into the Form of a Servant,</hi> and <hi>to Death, the Death of the Croſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>All</hi> This is to Appear in Glory; And as there was a <hi>Fullneſs of Time</hi> for that <hi>Firſt Manifeſtation of Chriſt;</hi> So there is (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 10.) <hi>a Diſpenſation of the Fullneſs of Times</hi> (not only of <hi>Time,</hi> but of <hi>Times,</hi> or of <hi>All Time</hi>) That <hi>he might gather together in One, all things in Chriſt; both which are in Heaven, and which are in Earth, even in Him.</hi> Till that Date be come, the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> cannot be.</p>
                     <p>Let me therefore deſire of you, That you would keep theſe Two Places of Scripture always in your Thoughts, with Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>Firſt Coming of Chriſt;</hi> and with Relation to his <hi>Second Glorious Coming and Appearance.</hi> There is <hi>the Fullneſs of Time;</hi> and Chriſt was Revealed firſt in That, <hi>as a Saerifice Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Sinners.</hi> And there is <hi>the Fullneſs of Times, of All Time;</hi>
                        <pb n="77" facs="tcp:41902:41"/> wherein <hi>all things in Heaven, and in Earth, are to be gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Him, even in Him;</hi> In which He <hi>is to appear, without Sin to Salvation,</hi> Heb. 9. Laſt.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Second</hi> Thing that makes it ſeem very ſtrange, that God ſhould continue the World ſo long, even after <hi>This Fullneſs of Time,</hi> is this; Becauſe <hi>the Heart of God</hi> (as I have often ſaid to you) <hi>cannot be to this World;</hi> Though He allows ſome kind of State and Condition to his Servants in it; ſome Enjoyment, ſome Supports, ſome Preſence of Himſelf, and of his Glory, and Grace in Chriſt; Yet it is far ſhort of what is to be; Becauſe This is a World that God cannot Love; and therefore the Glory of Things ſhall not be in the Preſent State of the World: Becauſe, I ſay, it is a World that God cannot Love; As Chriſt ſaid, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this World;</hi> not meaning, That it is not a Kingdom, that ſhall Appear, and be Viſible in the Creation of God, in Heaven, and Earth, ſtanding in all the Order and Beauty of it: That is not the meaning. But, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this World;</hi> That is, Not of this Preſent Corrupt State in it: It muſt come to that, That <hi>Time ſhall be no more,</hi> (as it is ſaid, <hi>Revel.</hi> the 10th) before the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> can be. There muſt be not only the <hi>Fullneſs of Time,</hi> but <hi>Time muſt be no more,</hi> of ſuch a kind as it hath been: And the <hi>Fullneſs of Times</hi> muſt come; And Then the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chrsſt</hi> ſhall appear: But as yet, it cannot: For the Scripture witneſſeth very plainly, and evidently to us, That though God gives his Servants Food, and Rayment, and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, and gives to many of them, Great Conveniencies, and Enjoyments of this World; Yet it is not, becauſe he loves the World, or likes their State and Condition in the World: For, (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>James) Ye Adulterers, and Adultereſſes, Know ye not that the Friendſhip of this World is Enmity with God? Whoſoever therefore will be a Friend of the World, is the Enemy of God,</hi> James 4. 4.</p>
                     <p>You ſee what a Great Conteſt there is between God and the World: And it can never be comprimiſed; It can never be reconciled: <hi>Whoſoever will be a Friend of the World, is the Enemy of God.</hi> And therefore, though we value the Things of the VVorld at ſo High a Rate; and the Conveniencies of the VVorld we make ſo Choice of; Yet, if we believe This <hi>Great Oracle of Truth;</hi> whoever will be a <hi>Friend of the World, is the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41902:42"/> Enemy of God:</hi> And, <hi>the Friendſhip of this World is Enmity with God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>O that we could carry the Thoughts and Conſiderations of This always upon our Minds! And ſo the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> tells us the very ſame thing, 1 <hi>John 2. 15. Love not the World, neither the things that are in the World: If any man love the World, the Love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not in him; For All that is in the World, the Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eye, and the Pride of Life; It is not of the Father, but it is of the World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And becauſe the VVorld is nothing but an Entertainment of Luſt; and that God cannot love it; Therefore <hi>the World paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth away:</hi> The World is continually in a Fleeting Condition; It is paſſing away: All this Form and State of things, that we now ſee; the Order and Manner of Things now is haſtening away as faſt as it can.</p>
                     <p>But you will ſay, <hi>Why does it not make more haſte, when God doth not Love it, and when it is Enmity to Him?</hi> And when, <hi>If any Man Love this World, he is an Enemy to God, and the Love of the Father is not in Him?</hi> O why ſhould we make it as if it were an Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing State, when it is not? But why is God pleaſed to continue it thus long?</p>
                     <p>To that, the Anſwer is; Becauſe, there is a Patience of God which is Exerciſed now in the World, and he will Exerciſe that Patience to the very laſt of the Time, he hath appointed to the World.</p>
                     <p>In regard of this, It is, as if God ſhould ſay, it is true; I do not Love this World; I do not Love to ſee Wicked Men Rolling and Tumbling in it, in all the Pleaſure, Voluptuouſneſs, Enjoyment, and Merriment, wherein they live; I do not Love to ſee my Servants ſo taken up about it, and ſo apt to be Drawn, and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it, as they are; And yet, for all this, Notwithſtanding it; I will let this World ſtand (ſaith God) that my patience may be known and underſtood: As the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9.) <hi>The Lord is not ſlack concerning his promiſe, as ſome Men count ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but is long ſuffering to us-ward: Not willing that any ſhould Periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repentance.</hi> The meaning of which Expreſſion, I cannot better expound to you, than by exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it, what a kind of patience it is, that is intended? For Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Men, they are wicked ſtill, Notwithſtanding, the Patience of God, and they will not Repent. And, God takes them away, one by one, as he <hi>ſees Good.</hi> And the VVorld continues very
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41902:42"/> bad, from one Generation to another: And yet God Exerciſe his patience towards it. You may underſtand it, by comparing this Expreſſion with the firſt part of the Chapter. They ſay (in <hi>ver.</hi> 4.) <hi>Where is the promiſe of his Coming? For ſince the Fathers fell aſleep; All things continue, as they were, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Creation. Since the Fathers fell aſleep;</hi> It is very Natural, to underſtand it of thoſe firſt Long-living <hi>Patriarchs</hi> before the <hi>Flood: Since They fell aſleep,</hi> and the <hi>Floud came,</hi> (ſay theſe <hi>Scoffers</hi>) There hath been no change of things here: The VVorld hath ſtood, juſt as it did from thence: And herein is the Patience of God, the VVorld was about One Thouſand Six Hundred and Fifty Six Years, when the <hi>Flood</hi> came. Now in Every ſuch Generation of the World, Every Thouſand Years of the World, God hath had as Great Reaſon to Deſtroy the World, as he had Then: For, Wickedneſs hath Grown to ſuch an Heighth, as it did then. And yet for all this, God Exerciſes the Patience and Long-Suffering, that he doth not Deſtroy the World again and again; and leave a few, as he did then, to people the World a-new.</p>
                     <p>But he continueth <hi>Summer,</hi> and <hi>Winter,</hi> and <hi>Harveſt,</hi> and the State of the World: He hath not Deſtroyed <hi>Every Living Thing,</hi> as He did then: Though there have been Notable Judgments in All Times, as I ſhall preſently ſpeak to you.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Third</hi> Thing, that ſhould make us very much wonder, That God ſhould keep the World a-foot ſo long; It is in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Great Inſolence, and Boldneſs of Wicked Men. What a Boldneſs is this! That they ſhould ſay, <hi>Where is the Promiſe of his Coming?</hi> And that they ſhould find ſomething or other to ſay, It is nothing, it is only a Thing that comes by Chance, or it is a Natural Cauſe, that the World continues.</p>
                     <p>Now, let it be granted, That it is only a Natural Cauſe; Who is the Great Ruler, and Conducter of Natural Cauſes, but God? And who hath ſuited Natural Cauſes to <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Seaſons,</hi> but God? Let the greateſt Atheiſt find out as Good Natural Cauſes, as he can: As for Example, the Cauſes of the Great Earthquake at <hi>Jamaica:</hi> There is nothing not the leaſt Thing that comes to paſs, but by His Wiſdom, and by his Power; And that it goes ſo far, and no farther, It is fully attributed to be to himſelf, and to no other.</p>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:41902:43"/>
                     <p>And therefore, I beſeech you, keep, as an Antidote againſt all the Atheiſtical Talk that you meet with in the World, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe Things; keep continually in your Mind what we read of, in the Book of <hi>Daniel.</hi> Several times indeed we read of Great Things ſpoken of God. <hi>Dan. 3. Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> made This Acknowledgment to God: <hi>Whoever</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall ſpeak a word againſt the God of Shaderach, Meſech, and Abed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nego, ſhall be cut in peices.</hi> He owned, and was convinced of ſuch a Mighty Power of God, that he would not endure there ſhould be a Mouth opened againſt him.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, It were very well, if Chriſtian Nations would learn by the Example of an <hi>Heathen Prince,</hi> That they would not ſuffer the Tongue of <hi>Atheiſts</hi> to walk about ſo brikly as it does in the World: <hi>They ſet their Mouths againſt the Heavens, and their Tongue rangeth through the whole Earth,</hi> as the Expreſſion is in the <hi>Pſalms.</hi> I ſay, 'Twere well that the <hi>Mouths of Atheiſts were ſtopt,</hi> and that they had ſuch notice from the Supreme Powers, that they might be Daunted, and afraid to Diſhonour the Great God of Heaven and Earth, and to make nothing of his Name, and the Works he doth in the World. So in the 34th Verſe of the 4th of <hi>Daniel, Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> This Heathen Prince, ſays: <hi>I Nebuchadnezzar lift up mine Eyes unto Heaven, and mine <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding returned unto me; And I bleſſed the moſt High, and I praiſed, and honoured him that liveth for ever, whoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion is an Everlaſting Dominion, and his Kingdom is from Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to Generation: And all the Inhabitants of the Earth are reputed as nothing; and he doth according to his Will in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth: and none can ſtay his Hand:</hi> That's a great Expreſſion, that I deſire you to keep in your Minds; <hi>None can ſtay his Hand:</hi> He can <hi>stay</hi> it Himſelf, but no other can <hi>ſtay</hi> it.</p>
                     <p>I would deſire you but to conſider, in regard of the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Providence toward This City: Of which, moſt Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (I perceive) were Senſible; ſome in Greater, and ſome in Leſſer Degree: This Place of Scripture does very much affect my Thoughts concerning it: <hi>Who can ſtay God's Hand?</hi> If He had ſaid, <hi>Let it tear up the Foundations of this City, and the Houſes in it,</hi> who could have <hi>ſtay'd his Hand?</hi> I beſeech you conſider, Why might it not have been ſo much more, as well
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41902:43"/> as ſo much, or ſo little? And yet Men are ready to ſay, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God did no more, he could do no more, except Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cauſes had been prepared to go on, and to go further: And becauſe the Earth Did give a kind of a Little Nodd, and no more, We are not ſenſible of the Great Hand of God; and who it was that was pleaſed to ſtay his Hand: It was His Own Grace, and His own Mercy, to ſtay his Hand: As if he ſhould ſay, I'll let you ſee the Danger, and no more than Juſt let you ſee it: And therefore, <hi>O that Men would praiſe the Lord for his Goodneſs, and for his Wonderful Works to the Children of Men!</hi> And that they would ſtand in Awe of Him, and conſider his Doings. For God forbears (you ſee) with an Infinite Patience and Long-Suffering: He lets Men Open their Mouths againſt Himſelf, and does not cut them off in the very moment, through his Mercies.</p>
                     <p>But, if you ſay, Will God always put up theſe Wrongs and Reproaches? Shall Right to this Great Name of God never be done?</p>
                     <p>Yes, He will make the World ſenſible of Him by Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: Or elſe there's a Day of Dreadful Recompence; As if God ſhould ſay, I have Time enough; I have an Eternity to ſhew my Diſpleaſure upon Them in; <hi>I have it Seal'd in my Treaſures; Their Foot ſhall ſlide in Due Time;</hi> And therefore I'll bear with them a little Time; Becauſe <hi>There's a Day of Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly Men;</hi> As the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Peter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. The Day of the Lord will come.</hi> Men ſay; Where is it? Saith the Apoſtle, (Verſe 10.) <hi>The Day of the Lord will come.</hi> And there is a <hi>Reſerving of Heaven and Earth unto Fire,</hi> againſt <hi>that Day,</hi> and <hi>the Perdition of ungodly men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And then, There is a Gracious Purpoſe of God: I deſire that you would take notice of that Place; Which ought indeed to be very much upon our Thoughts, in this very regard; That it is Propheſied, and foretold, <hi>That they ſhall come from the Ends of the Earth,</hi> Jer. 16. 20. <hi>Saying, ſhall a Man make Gods unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and they are no Gods? Therefore behold, I will this once.</hi> It is a very notable Expreſſion; Like that of <hi>ſhaking Heaven and Earth, yet once more</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>I ſhake not the Earth onely, but alſo Heaven; That thoſe things which cannot be ſhaken may remain; And that the things which can be ſhaken may be taken away at once: Therefore behold, I will this once cauſe them to know,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41902:44"/> I will cauſe them to know mine hand, and my might, and they ſhall know that my Name is the Lord.</hi> And this ſeems to be a Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and a Merciful Intention; For in Verſe 19. <hi>O Lord my Strength and my Fortreſs, and my Refuge in the Day of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Gentiles ſhall come unto thee from the Ends of the Earth, and ſhall ſay, ſurely our Fathers have Inherited Lies, Vanity, and things wherein there is no profit. Jeremy</hi> apprehends great Grace in God upon this Proſpect, and ſo applies to Him in his own Caſe, <hi>O Lord my Strength,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>So you may ſee why God bears the Reproaches of them, that contemn him; Wherefore do the <hi>Wicked contemn God?</hi> Saith God, I'll have a <hi>Day of Perdition</hi> for Ungodly Men: And I'll have a Day, when the <hi>Gentiles ſhall come from the Ends of the Earth: And for once, they ſhall know my Might, and my Power; And that my Name is</hi> Jehovah. I'll bring all mine Home, my Patience is for them, that they might not Periſh, but come to <hi>Repentance,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>A Fourth thing that makes it very ſtrange, that God conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues the World ſo long, is, Becauſe there are ſo many Prayers of his Saints for the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> to come; And that the Wickedneſs of the Wicked may be brought to an End; And that the Oppreſſion and Perſecution of his Church may be at an End. It is a wonder therefore, that God ſhould not hear the Prayers of his Servants, and bring all theſe things to their great Iſſue.</p>
                     <p>But now, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath given us an Account of this, <hi>Luk. 18. 7, 8. And ſhall not God avenge his own Elect, which cry Day and Night unto him, tho he bear long with them? I tell you, that he will avenge them ſpeedily. Nevertheleſs, when the Son of Man cometh, ſhall he find Faith on the Earth? He will avenge them ſpeedily, tho he tarry long.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You may think, thoſe things Contradict one another; To tarry long, and yet to avenge them ſpeedily: Yet he will come, and he will avenge.</p>
                     <p>As it was ſaid concerning the <hi>Souls under the Altar; Stay, till the reſt of your Brethren are filled up;</hi> And then there ſhall be Vengeance indeed to the Enemy, and a Recompence to his Servants; And yet how little Faith concerning this even among the Servants of God!</p>
                     <p>The laſt thing why you may think it very ſtrange, is this;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41902:44"/> Becauſe the Apoſtle ſaid ſo long ago, <hi>The Ends of the World were come.</hi> I confeſs, it may ſeem to give an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> ſome hold, ſome advantage; You know how many places of Scripture ſpeak to this purpoſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 12. Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>All theſe things happened unto them for Enſamples: And they are Written for our Admonition, upon whom the Ends of the World are come:</hi> And (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>John) This is the Laſt time, and hereby we know it, this is the laſt hour; And theſe are the laſt Days;</hi> All this is ſpoken, and yet for all this, the Kingdom of Chriſt hath not come: And Sixteen Hundred Years, and more are paſſed, ſince theſe things have been ſpoken.</p>
                     <p>Now Indeed, theſe things look very ſtrange, and might make Men think, that there is no ſuch thing, as the <hi>Coming of Chriſt;</hi> For tho the Apoſtles Preached it, and they may ſay, indeed, Men that are Preachers, may perſwade Men ſo; And indeed, they ſay ſo; But we ſee nothing coming to paſs; Did not the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeak of the <hi>laſt Day,</hi> the <hi>last Hour,</hi> and the <hi>laſt Time?</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> of the very <hi>laſt of Times?</hi> As the word is very Emphatical in the <hi>Greek;</hi> And yet for all that, it is not come.</p>
                     <p>To all this, I would onely ſay theſe two things; Or rather, give you two places of Scripture, how theſe things come to paſs, In the 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> ch. 2. v. 3. The Apoſtle tells us plainly, there was ſuch a Noiſe (as I may ſo expreſs it) of the Doctrine of the Apoſtles, concerning the <hi>laſt Times;</hi> That all Chriſtians then were upon the Expectation, were upon the Gaze, when that <hi>Coming of Chriſt ſhould be:</hi> Now, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Let no Man deceive you by any means; For that day ſhall not come, except there come a falling away firſt.</hi> Except there be an <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> in the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> firſt, <hi>That Day</hi> ſhall not come. And therefore, don't wonder, tho it be called the <hi>laſt Time,</hi> in regard of the <hi>Fullneſs of Time,</hi> and Chriſt coming at it, and becauſe of the laſt of the four <hi>Monarchies;</hi> Yet it is not ſo the <hi>laſt Time,</hi> but that it muſt give Room to an <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> to come upon it: And ſo in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> as I have often ſpoken to you. <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. And in the <hi>12th</hi> and <hi>13th</hi> Chapters. There are to be <hi>Time, Times, and Half a Time: A Thouſand two Hundred, and Sixty Days: Fourty and two Months.</hi> All which (as I have ſaid often to you) make up <hi>Twelve Hundred and Sixty Years,</hi> between the Preaching of the Goſpel, the Chriſtian Empire, and the coming of Jeſus Chriſt: And
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41902:45"/> ſo I have ſpoken of the firſt thing, why there may ariſe ſuch thoughts upon this, that the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> is not come yet to this very Day. I come now to the Second thing, to give you very Great Reaſons, beſides what I have intimated alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to you, <hi>Why Chriſt hath not yet come.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. The Firſt Account I would give, is, That ſo very A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable Repreſentation of the Time of the Duration of the Creation, and of the Kingdom of Chriſt in Compare with it: The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> hath Given in his Second Epiſtle c. 3. 8. when he was ſpeaking of <hi>the Coming of Chriſt,</hi> and of the Long Delay of it; at which Atheiſts took Advantage, and Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>Scoffers,</hi> to play upon it; <hi>Saying, Where is the Promiſe of his Coming?</hi> The Apoſtle Reſolves the Objection, by preſſing Earneſtly on Chriſtians, not to be <hi>Ignorant of One Thing,</hi> or not to let it <hi>lie Hid from them;</hi> Viz. <hi>That One Day is with the Lord as a Thouſand Years;</hi> Referring to Each Day of the Creation, Deſigned by God as a Type of a Thouſand Years Duration of the Creation; They being then Six, before the <hi>Seventh,</hi> then Sanctified and Bleſſed by God as a <hi>SABBATH,</hi> the Type of the Grand <hi>Sabbath;</hi> They pourtray Six Thouſand Years <hi>Duration of the Creation,</hi> before the Great <hi>Sabbatiſm of the Kingdom of Christ;</hi> And that being Given under the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of a <hi>Thouſand Years, Revel.</hi> 20. Yet thoſe <hi>Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Years</hi> are in the Deſignation of God, That <hi>One Day of the Lord,</hi> That <hi>Illustrious Day,</hi> That <hi>Day of Judgment, The Great Day, The Day;</hi> if then Jeſus Chriſt comes in the End of the Fourth Millenary, or Thouſand of Years, as in the <hi>Full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Time;</hi> And God hath Laid out Six Thouſand for the Duration of the World until that <hi>Thouſand Years,</hi> (Except what <hi>Shortning</hi> ſhall be for <hi>the Elects Sake,</hi> in the End of the Sixth Millenary) as <hi>the Fullneſs of Times,</hi> or of <hi>All Time;</hi> It is very Evident, The Coming of the <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> after His Death, and Reſurrection, muſt be under the Delay of about Two Thouſand Years; as have now Already ſo near Run out.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. If there be ſuch a Number of the Elect to be brought Home to God, and to Chriſt; And that They have lain ſcattered through theſe near Two Thouſand Years, and muſt be brought in before <hi>the Kingdom of Chriſt;</hi> Then the Kingdom of Chriſt cannot be, till they are Brought in. But ſo
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41902:45"/> the Apoſtle ſhews, <hi>Heb. 4. 4, 5, 6, 7, &amp;c.</hi> Some muſt Enter into <hi>Reſt</hi> to the Laſt. And of this the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks in the ſame Diſcourſe, as a Further Reſolution of the <hi>Scoffers</hi> Queſtion, <hi>Where is the Promiſe of His Coming? The Lord is not Slack concerning his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, as ſome Men count Slackneſs; but is Long-Suffering to us-ward. Not willing that Any ſhould periſh, but that All ſhould come to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> Verſe 9.</p>
                     <p>That This hath, in ſome General Latitude, a Reſpect to All Men, I would not Deny; but that is the Loweſt, and Leaſt Part of its Intention; For ſo it hath not its Efficacy, nor its Effect; but take it with Relation to the Elect of God, And ſo it hath Full Effect; Not One Periſhes, but Every Single One <hi>comes to Repentance.</hi> If therefore there is ſuch a Number of Elect to be Brought Home to Repentance, who ſhall have their Lot in the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> at his <hi>Coming:</hi> His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then muſt needs be Delayed till All the Children of the <hi>Bride-Chamber</hi> be Brought into a Condition to meet the <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom</hi> with <hi>Oil</hi> in their <hi>Veſſels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. There is ſuch a Space of Time Determined by God, Settled, Fixed and Declared in the <hi>Sure Word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,</hi> Lin'd out by <hi>Four Monarchies,</hi> that muſt Runn out Themſelves; And there is a Particular Aſſignation of Time to the Laſt State of the <hi>Fourth,</hi> the Laſt of Them; <hi>Viz.

But then Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, at the very Beginning of <hi>Half Time,</hi> Chriſt took the Firſt Opportunity of making a Seizure; <hi>viz.</hi> at the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and of <hi>Swearing,</hi> there ſhould be <hi>Time</hi> of ſuch ſort <hi>no more;</hi> but in the <hi>Days of the Seventh Trumpet;</hi> When he ſhall begin to found the <hi>Myſtery of God,</hi> Viz. <hi>The Kingdom of Chriſt, ſhall be Finiſhing, as he hath ſpoken by all his Servants the Prophets:</hi> Which ſhall begin at 1697, So near approaching; All which things have been fully, by the Aſſiſtances of God, made out, and publickly ſet forth; And are now onely ſo far briefly Repreſented, as to give ſatisfaction to this doubt; How comes it to paſs, that the <hi>Coming of the Bridegroom</hi> hath been thus long Delay'd?

Let us beware of the Accounting the delay of the <hi>Bridegrooms Coming</hi> to any thing in the Courſe of Nature, or, as if the World could bear up it ſelf, or Perpetuate it ſelf; As they of whom the <hi>Apoſtle ſpeaks,</hi> who are <hi>willfully Ignorant,</hi> that the World by the very <hi>Word of God,</hi> was ſettled ſo out of, and yet in ſuch a Neighbourhood to the <hi>Water;</hi> that it depended wholly on the <hi>Word of his Power,</hi> not to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown by it: And that the <hi>Heavens</hi> and <hi>Earth that now are,</hi> are ſo Reſerv'd, are <hi>Treaſured</hi> up for Fire at the Time Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God, for <hi>Perdition</hi> of ſuch, and of All Ungodly

                     <p>I Have in ſeveral Diſcourſes, led you through the great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and Senſe of our Lord in this Parable: Which is one of thoſe, wherein (as he ſpeaks, <hi>Matth. 13.) he opened his Mouth in Parables,</hi> and <hi>uttered Things that had been kept ſecret from the foundation of the World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have ſpoken of ſeveral particulars herein; and will go directly upon what is now before us, and to be ſpoken of: and that is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That while the Bridegroom tarried; all theſe</hi> Virgins, <hi>both the</hi> wiſe, <hi>and the</hi> unwiſe, ſlumbred <hi>and</hi> ſlept.</p>
                     <p>Now, it is indeed, a great difficulty to find out the very meaning and ſenſe of our Lord in this part of the Parable: For, it ſeems ſtrange, that not only the <hi>unwiſe,</hi> but that the <hi>wiſe Virgins ſlumbred and ſlept.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And, to give a ſenſe of this, ſuitable to the meaning, and to the reſt of the Parable, I ſhall at this time, by the aſſiſtance of God, undertake; and ſo to Diſcourſe of it accordingly.</p>
                     <p>I obſerve therefore to you, That here are two Words uſed by our Lord: They <hi>ſlumbred,</hi> and they <hi>ſlept.</hi> I look upon theſe Words to have two very different ſenſes, though they may ſeem to be perfectly alike, And that <hi>ſlumbring</hi> and <hi>ſleeping,</hi> (as indeed, Scripture and common Language, generally join both together) mean one and the ſame thing.</p>
                     <p>But, I underſtand the Firſt, concerning the ſpiritual ſtate of the Churches of Chriſt, during the delay of Chriſts coming, and of the Kingdom of Chriſt. All the whole ſtate of the Chriſtian Church, hath been from the very beginning of the <hi>working of</hi> the <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity,</hi> it hath been in a <hi>ſlumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> condition.</p>
                     <p>But then, the <hi>ſleeping,</hi> I look upon that to be an expreſſion
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41902:48"/> of the dying of the Servants of Chriſt, all along, from the Time of the Reſurrection of Chriſt, to this very Time; And the latter is conſequent upon the former.</p>
                     <p>For, I am fully perſwaded, That if the Power and Glory, and vigour of Chriſtianity; in a ſettled ſtate of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; if that had immediately followed upon the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, and the giving of the Spirit, that pouring out of the Spirit that was in the Apoſtles days; I do fully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, there had been no ſuch Thing as dying: Even as when the Kingdom of Chriſt comes, there ſhall be no more Death; So, if the Kingdom of Chriſt had immediately proceeded, upon the firſt Preaching of the Goſpel, there had been no <hi>ſleeping:</hi> If there had been no <hi>ſlumbring,</hi> there had been no <hi>ſleeping.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And, I ſhall give you two great Reaſons, why I underſtand the Word <hi>ſleeping,</hi> concerning <hi>dying: They ſlumbred;</hi> that is, the Power of Chriſtianity did not ſhew it ſelf upon them; And ſo they <hi>ſlept,</hi> that is, they <hi>died.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt Reaſon I would give you of it is this, Becauſe the Intention of our Lord, in this Parable, is chiefly, That we may look to the Power of Chriſtianity in our own hearts, to ſuch a power of it, as that we ſhould be able to appear with Chriſt when he comes to the <hi>Wedding;</hi> That our <hi>Lamps</hi> ſhould not then go out. The great Meaning, the great Scope of the Parable is this, That we ſhould look to have the very Life, and Truth of Grace, ſo in our hearts, that we may have a Light of it when Chriſt comes, that will not go out in the very time, in that very inſtant Time, wherein we ſhould go with him to the <hi>Wedding.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, it is very plain, That the <hi>Wiſe Virgins</hi> indeed, had this Light: For, it is ſaid of them (<hi>ver. 10.) They that were ready</hi> (which is ſpoken of the <hi>wiſe Virgins) they went in with him to the Marriage, and the Door was ſhut.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that if the <hi>wiſe Virgins had ſlept</hi> in that ſenſe, that the <hi>fooliſh Virgins</hi> did; I ſay, if they had ſlept in the ſame ſenſe, they would not have been <hi>ready</hi> to go into the <hi>Wedding</hi> with Chriſt. So that theſe <hi>wiſe Virgins,</hi> they did <hi>watch,</hi> and they did not ſleep in the main ſenſe of the Parable: For, they were ready to go in with him to the <hi>Wedding.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Altho therefore they did die, yet in the great concernment
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41902:48"/> of Eternity, they did not ſleep away their time; they did not loſe their opportunity of providing a Treaſure of Oil.</p>
                     <p>A Second Reaſon that I give you, Why this ſleeping is not meant of the ſpiritual eſtate of theſe <hi>Virgins,</hi> but only of their dying, is,</p>
                     <p>Becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>At Midnight there was a Cry made;</hi> And <hi>then they aroſe and trimmed their Lamps.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now this Midnight is that ſtate of death, in regard of the Body, in which all the ſervants of Chriſt lie, till that Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, till that <hi>Firſt Reſurrection</hi> that is ſpoken of. This is indeed, like a <hi>Midnight:</hi> For, when the Bodies of Saints lie in the Duſt, it is as if a Midnight were upon them, as to that viſible ſtate and appearance of Body; though their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are indeed with Chriſt, yet their Bodies lie as in a Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night.</p>
                     <p>And, if you ſpeak of the Apoſtles of Chriſt, <hi>Peter, Paul, John,</hi> and the reſt of them; they are all of them (as it were) in a Midnight ſleep, as to their Bodies, And therefore, the <hi>Midnight</hi> is ſo properly to be underſtood; Whereas, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Spiritual State of the Church of Chriſt, which is before his Coming, before the Glory of his Coming, it ſhall not be a <hi>Midnight.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For, as I have often endeavoured to make plain unto you, That aſſoon as ever thoſe <hi>Time, Times</hi> and <hi>half Time</hi> of the Antichriſtian Power are at an end, immediately, a great Light, and a great Glory of the Goſpel ſhall ſhine out, that it ſhall not be a <hi>Midnight;</hi> Indeed, the <hi>Light</hi> will not be perfectly <hi>clear,</hi> or <hi>precious,</hi> till the Glory of the Kingdom of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>But I cannot but hope and expect, That within very few years, there will be ſuch a ſtate of Chriſtianity, ſuch a ſtate of the Goſpel; the <hi>Everlaſting Goſpel</hi> preached through the World; There will be ſuch a new Miſſion and Commiſſion of the Servants of Chriſt, That it ſhall not be to be accounted a Midnight in that regard: Nor ſhall the Coming of Chriſt be ſo on the ſudden, but that there will be great Light con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it; When that <hi>Angel</hi> that <hi>flyes</hi> through the <hi>midſt of Heaven, (Rev.</hi> 14.) ſhall have preach'd the Everlaſting Goſpel to every Nation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe are the Reaſons why I cannot underſtand this Word <hi>ſleeping,</hi> to be a repreſentation of the ſpiritual ſtate
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41902:49"/> of the Church, and Servants of Chriſt; But, I do underſtand by the <hi>ſlumbring,</hi> That there is ſuch a <hi>deadiſh,</hi> ſuch a <hi>drouſie,</hi> ſuch a <hi>benumm'd</hi> ſtate of Chriſtianity, as indeed we ſee in the very beſt, to this day.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the Obſervation that I ſhall lay down, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to open to you, is this:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Chriſtianity, in regard of the preſent ſtate of Chriſtians, and as they have been ſince</hi> Epheſus (Rev. 2.) left its firſt love; <hi>ſince there was a decay of the Glory and. Purity, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Goſpel from the Apoſtles Time; Since then, I ſay, Chriſtianity, in the Power and Spirit of it, though it hath not downright ſlept; yet it hath been, as in a</hi> ſlumber.</p>
                     <p>For indeed, I have often ſaid it, and I cannot be in a remove from it; That Chriſtianity is not as it was intended by Chriſt, it ſhould be, We have not ſeen the State and Glory of it. And therefore I ſhall make it my buſineſs to repreſent to you, by ſuch Repreſentations as the Scripture hath given us, how the Power of Chriſtianity hath faultred thus long; and that it will come to its perfectly awakened State, when the <hi>Kingdoms of this World</hi> are <hi>Proclaimed to be the Lord's and his Chriſt's.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And I ſhall date this failure, eſpecially to two Times; and one of them will fall directly upon our ſelves.</p>
                     <p>Firſt of all, the Time when the <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity</hi> was <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in the Apoſtles days.</p>
                     <p>For, you may plainly behold that, by the very expreſs words of the Apoſtle; that in his own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Time, there was a <hi>working of the Myſtery of Iniquity;</hi> Then began the great decay and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of the Glory of Chriſtianity, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 'Tis a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that I have often turned you to, and therefore I hope you are acquainted with it. I am perſwaded, the firſt Chriſtians in the Apoſtles days, needed as much to be reſtrained, in thinking that the <hi>Day of Chriſt was at hand,</hi> as we have need to be ſpurr'd on, and to be provoked, and to be earneſtly perſwaded to think, that <hi>the Day of Chriſt is at hand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For, ſo the Apoſtle writes, <hi>We beſeech you,</hi> ſaith he, as if he was in a buſineſs of greateſt earneſtneſs, and that he could not tell how he ſhould prevail enough upon them, to whom he wrote in it, <hi>ver. 1. We beſeech you, Brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by our gathering together unto him, That ye be not ſoon ſhaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by Spirit,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41902:49"/> nor by Word, nor by Letter, as from us, as that the Day of Chriſt is at hand.</hi> They were ready to think, <hi>The Day of Chriſt</hi> was to come juſt then: Therefore the Apoſtle makes this earneſt entreaty of them, that they would not expect it: You ſee what a different poſture we are in now: It is a hard matter to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade any one to take off their hearts from the World, and from loving it too deep, and from thinking here's a ſecurity in this World, and we may do as our Fathers have done before us, for ſo many Hundred Years in the Profeſſion of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: We may be buying and ſelling, and getting Eſtates, and laying a foundation in this World; Who is it, that doth not count it a ſort of Madneſs, to diſſwade them from ſuch a thing?</p>
                     <p>But the Chriſtians of that Time, they needed as earneſt a perſwaſion, That they might not think that the <hi>Day of Christ</hi> was ſo <hi>near at hand.</hi> And ſo Chriſt, in the 19th of <hi>Luke,</hi> ſpeaks that Parable that they ſhould not, becauſe they did think <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven was nigh at hand:</hi> He ſpake a Parable, on purpoſe to aſſure them, that it was not ſo nigh: But Alas! we need ſtrong perſwaſions to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>And, I may ſay the contrary to the Chriſtians of this Time, <hi>I beſeech you Brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jeſus,</hi> and <hi>by our gathering together unto him,</hi> that you would not <hi>be ſhaken in mind,</hi> by the general way of Peoples Profeſſion, and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Hearing, as if the <hi>Day of Chriſt</hi> were not <hi>at hand.</hi> And as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Let no man deceive you by any means, for that day ſhall not come, except there come a falling away firſt, and that Man of Sin be revealed, the Son of Perdition.</hi> So I ſay to you, That day is near approaching; For that <hi>falling away,</hi> that <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> from Chriſtianity, it hath been, and it is now ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near to its expiring: And therefore the great reaſon, why it could not be then, it is now a reaſon, why it muſt ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be; becauſe the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> hath been ſo long; becauſe the Time, and the laſt Date, by God, and by Chriſt is almoſt run out, and expired: that is, the <hi>Time, Times</hi> and <hi>half Time.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here therefore, to ſpeak and bring home the thing to the preſent purpoſe I am upon; Since this <hi>Apoſtacy began to work,</hi> ſince that very Time, Chriſtianity hath been in a <hi>ſlumber.</hi> For, in this ſecond <hi>Chap. v.</hi> 7. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>the Myſtery of Iniquity doth already work.</hi> Now, as ſoon as ever the <hi>Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41902:50"/> of Iniquity began to work:</hi> immediately there began a ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber upon the Chriſtian Religion: And therefore one would wonder, Indeed, it is a place that one would wonder to read, and to find, in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> what the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Chap. 2. 20. For I have no man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded</hi> (ſpeaking of <hi>Timotheus) who will naturally, genuinely, ſincerely care for your ſtate: For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>All ſeek their own, not the things which are Jeſus Chriſt's.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſpeak of him, as an extraordinary Perſon, ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. By this we may plainly ſee, it was a great variation from what you read in the ſecond and third <hi>Chapters</hi> of the <hi>Acts,</hi> where they minded nothing but only the Promotion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity: <hi>No one called any thing their own;</hi> they minded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Chriſtianity it ſelf. But Chriſtianity hath been in a <hi>ſlumber</hi> ever ſince; or elſe we ſhould be Chriſtians of another Life, of another Spirit, of another Power; I ſay, were it not that Chriſtianity hath been in a ſlumber ſo long.</p>
                     <p>And this is with a great deal of ſpiritual Wit, (if I may ſo ſpeak) and a great deal of ſpiritual Elegancy ſet out to us in the Song of <hi>Solomon.</hi> I ſhall have occaſion to make great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Deſcription that is there given to us. <hi>Sol. Song, c. 5. v. 2. I ſleep, but my heart waketh; it is the voice of my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved that knocketh, ſaying, open to me, my Siſter, my Love, my Dove, my undefiled: for my Head is filled with Dew, and my Locks with the Drops of the Night.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What's the meaning of this? Indeed, I know Men are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſay, That theſe things are only Imaginations and Whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and Apprehenſions of ones own that ſpeaks of them.</p>
                     <p>But I have found a clear Thread, and Line drawn from <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s time, till the very Glorious Coming of Chriſt, in this very <hi>Song of Solomon.</hi> And I find, that the Time when the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> came in, is juſt under the very deſcription that we here have.</p>
                     <p>As therefore, when after a clear Day, a Sun-ſhiny-day, at Night, the <hi>Drops of Dew,</hi> you know, they fall thick upon the heads of thoſe that are in the Air. So Chriſt doth declare, <hi>A night ſhould come,</hi> at that time upon his Church. <hi>My head</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is wet with the drops of Dew of the Night:</hi> Becauſe Chriſtianity was drawing its Ceremonies long; they began then; at that very time, they begun then to draw out <hi>the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41902:50"/> of the Evening:</hi> A great many Ceremonies came into Chriſtianity, and a Form and Way of Prayer ſuitable and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to it, and ſuch ways of Preaching as prepar'd for it. And then they came to be more intent upon the Remembrance of ſuch a Saint, and ſuch a Martyr, and keeping their Days; and drawing as many outward Forms and Ceremonies of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as they could, and they neglected the Power of it. And this Chriſt obſerves, and calls it, <hi>the Drops of Dew, the Drops of the Night upon his Head:</hi> And then the Church of Chriſt began to <hi>ſlumber.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this is the firſt Time that is to be taken notice of in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the <hi>ſlumbering,</hi> even of the <hi>wiſe Virgins;</hi> Of which I ſhall ſpeak preſently more particularly to you.</p>
                     <p>The Second is this; And I deſire that none would be off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ended, or think me cenſorious in ſpeaking of it: For I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign nothing, (I can truly Appeal to God) but only to ſpeak the Truth, and the Reality of Things, in a Point, where Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calls for the ſpeaking of it. That is, This <hi>Slumber</hi> hath been ſince the <hi>Reformation;</hi> As ſoon as ever the firſt Power had ſhewn it ſelf; There was indeed, a mighty Spirit of Truth, and Spirit of Holineſs in the firſt <hi>Reformation;</hi> Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were then Chriſtians of a high Rate, of a high Degree, of a high Excellency: How willing were they to ſuffer in the days of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> in our own Nation? How did they love one another? How did the Power and Glory of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity appear in them? But, I hope, it will be no ſcandal to ſay this, That it hath been in a decay for a Hundred Years: For it is the very expreſs words of one, that is, Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> that we know by the Name of the Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury;</hi> he ſpake it plainly and openly in this City, <hi>That the</hi> Reformation <hi>has</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Sermon, Of not falling out by the Way.</note> 
                        <hi>been loſing ground for theſe Hundred Years.</hi> And whence is this? But only a great <hi>ſlumber</hi> hath fallen upon the Profeſſion of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> for a Hundred Years: And the Glory and Power and Excellency of Chriſtianity, we have not yet reſtored to its own Beauty, and to its own Glory.</p>
                     <p>And this, I have endeavoured ſeveral times, (both in Diſcourſe and in Writing) to make plain, That the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> is the Repreſentation of the Generality of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Churches, under the <hi>Reformation.</hi> And, I deſire, that you would but read, and weigh the Deſcription that is given of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41902:51"/> that Church, <hi>Rev. 3. 1, 2. And to the Angel of the Church in Sardis, write, Theſe things ſaith he that hath the Seven Spirits of God, and the Seven Stars; I know thy works, that thou haſt a Name that thou liveſt, and art dead. Be watchful (ſaith he) and ſtrengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die. Be watchful:</hi> What's the meaning of that? But only to ſhew, that the State of the <hi>Proteſtant Churches</hi> had fallen into a great <hi>ſlumber,</hi> a great <hi>drowſineſs:</hi> And therefore it is, that we know ſo little of the Power of Chriſtianity at this day. <hi>And ſaith he, I have not found thy works perfect before God. Remember therefore how thou haſt received, and heard, and hold fast and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. If therefore thou ſhalt not watch</hi> (obſerve that) <hi>I will come on thee as a Thief, and thou ſhalt not know what hour I will come upon thee; if thou doſt not watch.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here we plainly ſee what is oppoſed to <hi>ſlumbering,</hi> it is <hi>watching.</hi> And when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Watch,</hi> ſo often, and ſo much; it ſignifies, that his Church would fall into a ſlumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition; <hi>it had a Name to live,</hi> it was not perfectly <hi>dead:</hi> But it was not vigorous, and powerful in the ways of Chriſtianity, And therefore <hi>watch,</hi> and <hi>ſtrengthen the things that remain, which are ready to die.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I'll give you only two Arguments, why I am of this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That this very Parable I am upon, does look directly upon the ſtate of the <hi>Proteſtant Churches;</hi> and ſo upon our ſelves, as in the Profeſſion of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> at this very Time; I'll give you the two Arguments, and then I'll go on in a more practical way of diſcourſing the particulars, of this <hi>ſlumbring</hi> of Chriſtians in the Profeſſion of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt Argument I give you is,</p>
                     <p>Becauſe it is now the Time, It is now the Time eſpecially, when <hi>our Lord delays his coming.</hi> For there ſhall not be <hi>Time, Times,</hi> nor ſo much, <hi>as half Time</hi> any more whole and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire; For at the <hi>Reformation</hi> Chriſt began to make an appearance of his Kingdom, and of his Coming; And it is certain, the bringing in of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> as all true <hi>Proteſtants</hi> own, it was one of the greateſt Works of Providence that ever hath been known in the World, and eſpecially ſince the days of Chriſt. It was ſtrange and wonderful, in the Times when God did it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he ſhould bring in a <hi>Reformation</hi> againſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41902:51"/> ſuch high Pretences, as that of <hi>The Catholick Church,</hi> as <hi>Rome</hi> was called; and againſt the <hi>Papacy</hi> and <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> that took upon themſelves to be the great Patrons of, and Pretenders to Chriſtian Religion, and the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> true Votaries and Servants of it, to have all things good within themſelves. Now, That ſuch a poor incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Perſon as <hi>Luther</hi> was, ſhould make oppoſition to ſuch a Body; when as the Kings and Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> were utter Enemies to the <hi>Reformation:</hi> It was a Mighty Power of God. And, as I have often ſhew'd; <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. is the very Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the Reformation; <hi>Chriſt came down from Heaven, clothed with a Cloud, and with a Rainbow upon his head. And he ſet his right Foot upon the Sea, and his left Foot upon the Earth, and cryed with a loud Voice, as when a Lyon roareth, and ſware by him that liveth for ever and ever, That Time, and Times; and even of half Time, that it ſhould be no longer.</hi> Who would not (I ſay) but have expected, that Chriſt ſhould immediately have come, and changed the World, and brought in his Kingdom?</p>
                     <p>But our Lord <hi>delays his Coming</hi> only, till the Hundred and Eighty Years are made up; of which, there wants only now but Five Years. And, at the preſent, there is a great delay; though I make no doubt, It will not be long. But yet Men think, Chriſt <hi>hath delayed his Coming;</hi> and <hi>where is the Promiſe of it?</hi> and that he hath quite forgot it. In this Time therefore, of the Lord's delaying his Coming, there is ſuch a great ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber upon the Chriſtian Church.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond Place, I have this great Reaſon, that moves me much to think, that the preſent delay, that the Parable ſpeaks of, under that <hi>ſpiritual ſlumber</hi> of the Churches of Chriſt, hath run along with the Time ſince the <hi>Reformation;</hi> Becauſe Chriſt ſaith, in the firſt Words, <hi>Then ſhall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto Ten Virgins:</hi> When? Why it ſhall be at that Time, as in the 24th of <hi>Matthew;</hi> though we divide <hi>Chapters,</hi> yet the ſenſe is not divided, nor our Saviour's Sermon divided; but our Lord is ſtill going on in his Diſcourſe, <hi>Mat. 24. 48, 49, &amp;c. But and if that evil Servant ſhall ſay in his heart, my Lord delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his coming, and ſhall begin to ſmite his fellow-ſervants, and to eat and drink with the drunken: The Lord of that ſervant ſhall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of; and ſhall cut him in ſunder, and appoint him his portion with the Hypocrites: There ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:41902:52"/>
                     <p>There was never a greater Hypocriſie in the World than the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy:</hi> To which they ſay (you know, in Reverence) <hi>Your Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> as we ſay to Princes, <hi>Your Majeſty,</hi> or <hi>Your Highneſs.</hi> And they ſay, <hi>Your Holineſs,</hi> a Blaſphemous Aſſumption; and therefore <hi>he ſhall appoint him his portion with the Hypocrites;</hi> Becauſe he hath been the <hi>Evil Servant,</hi> that hath ſaid, <hi>My Lord delayeth his coming.</hi> And <hi>ſo he begins to Eat and Drink with the Drunken,</hi> and to <hi>Smite the Men-ſervants, and Maid-ſervants:</hi> That is, to Perſecute the true Servants of Jeſus Chriſt, and of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Then ſhall the Kingdom of Heaven be likned</hi> unto <hi>Ten Virgins, which took their Lamps,</hi> &amp;c. when that Judgment is.</p>
                     <p>So that the Time before the puniſhing of this <hi>Bad Servant,</hi> and the cutting him off, and Devoting him to the Wrath and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of God; Before this, there falls ſuch a <hi>Slumber</hi> as this.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore, Having made the way, I ſhall Endeavour to go on, and to ſpeak to theſe two things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> To ſhew wherein (as to our particular) we are to obſerve a Spirit of <hi>Slumber;</hi> and that the power of Chriſtianity does take ſmall hold of us. And then,</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Second</hi> place; I ſhall Endeavour to ſhew you, wherein the <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Fooliſh Virgins</hi> Differ; though they are both in a <hi>Slumber;</hi> and they Die alike, they Sleep alike, yet there is a very vaſt and great difference betwixt them.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Firſt</hi> place, This is a very great Argument that we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Slumber</hi> of Chriſtianity; That we are not really in a Holy Tranſport, in all the Services, and Enjoyments, and Ordinances of Chriſtianity. Indeed, we make a ſhift to paſs through the Form, to hold up the Form of Prayer, and of Preaching, and of the Lord's Supper, and of good Diſcourſe ſometimes one with another: But we have not that mighty Affection, we are juſt like Perſons in a <hi>Slumber:</hi> You know, they underſtand ſomething of what you ſay to them; and they make ſome kind of Anſwer: But they are ſo low and ſo imperfect herein; that we may be ſure, they are not in the Vigour of their Senſes, and of their Underſtanding, and of their Reaſoning, and of their Diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>Surely, If we were raiſed to the Power of Chriſtianity, we ſhould have more of thoſe High Elevations of mind, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks of; and that the Holy Men of Old, in former times, ſpeak of. We ſhould have ſuch flaming Deſires after God, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41902:52"/> Chriſt, that our hearts would be Raviſhed, and we ſhould be drawn (as it were) out of our ſelves, in theſe things; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we do but Nod (as I may ſo expreſs it) in our way of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; Or, when we ſeem to do ſomething, we are preſently in a kind of <hi>Slumber,</hi> ſo that there wants the Power and Life of it. When <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>How ſweet is thy Word to my taſte? Sweeter than the Hony,</hi> or <hi>the Hony Comb;</hi> It was another State than we are in; All the 119 <hi>Pſalm</hi> is a perpetual Rapture and Extaſie of Heart; All that time he was awake: So, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven</hi> but <hi>Thee?</hi> And there is <hi>none upon Earth that I deſire beſide Thee?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And, <hi>My Heart and my Fleſh Faileth; but thou art the ſtrength of my Heart and my Portion for ever. My Soul breaketh for the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it hath unto thy Judgments at all times.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All our Converſe with Chriſt, and with the Holy Ordinances of Chriſt, and all our Drawings nigh to God, They would be with a Holy Tranſport. So in the 42. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> ſaith <hi>David; As the</hi> Hart <hi>panteth after the water-Brooks, ſo panteth my Soul after thee O God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You cannot really ſuppoſe, but that if we were fully poſſeſt with Religion, indeed, we ſhould be carried out of our ſelves, in Love, and Service, and Thankfulneſs, and Obedience, and all the Powers of Holineſs and Religion; Whereas now, If a Perſon be but Civil to Religion, If he will but ſit patiently, and hear a Diſcourſe of it; Or if he can but endure to be called off from the World, to God; we look upon it as a great Attainment. But I ſay, If Chriſtianity were not under <hi>Slumber,</hi> in the Spirits of Men, we ſhould be in a high Tranſport; That, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the 2 <hi>Cor, 5. The love of Chriſt Conſtrains us,</hi> becauſe <hi>we thus judge.</hi> The Word (as the Learned Obſerve) ſignifies ſuch a kind of Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, as when <hi>Elijah</hi> was taken up by the Spirit, and carried hither and thither; So the love of Chriſt conſtrains us, that is, Tranſports us every way, <hi>Ver. 14. Wherefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>henceforth know we no man after the Fleſh</hi> (Ver. 16.) <hi>Yea, though we have known Chriſt after the Fleſh,</hi> yet <hi>now henceforth know we him ſo no more.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Surely, This is the <hi>Slumber</hi> of Chriſtianity, that we are taken ſo much with outward appearances, with out-ſides of men. The Apoſtle obſerved the <hi>Slumber</hi> of Chriſtianity, upon this account in his Day; <hi>James 2. 2. If there come into your Aſſembly a man with a Gold Ring, in goodly Apparel,</hi> &amp;c. Here Chriſtianity began to be in a <hi>Slumber;</hi> not but that due regard ought to be to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41902:53"/> Ranks of Men: But in this regard, we <hi>know Men too much after the fleſh,</hi> ſo that it argues Chriſtianity much in a <hi>Slumber.</hi> Do but read, I beſeech you; (don't think I ſpeak, either vainly, or without due conſideration of what I ſay) Do but read thoſe places of Scripture, that are ſo Eminent in ſetting out the Glory of Chriſtianity: <hi>While we look not</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 18) <hi>at the things which are ſeen,</hi> but <hi>at the things which are not ſeen; for the things which are ſeen are temporal, but the things which are not ſeen, are eternal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now I ſay, who is it, that loves thus to look upon the <hi>things that are ſeen</hi> as nothing, and the <hi>things that are not ſeen</hi> as all? So (ſaith he) <hi>We know that if our earthly houſe of this Tabernacle were diſſolved.</hi> (chap. 5. 1.) <hi>we have a building of God, an houſe not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens.</hi> ver. 2. <hi>For in this we groan earneſtly,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle.</p>
                     <p>Who <hi>groans earneſtly?</hi> I do not ſpeak at all to be cenſorious, or to tax Men beyond Reaſon, or any way to juſtifie my ſelf; but only this I am clearly ſenſible of, That the General Character of the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> is fallen upon all the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Churches, and upon all <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Perſons: As <hi>David</hi> ſaith in another caſe, There is no one that doth not <hi>Slumber,</hi> (I may ſay) no not one. Though there are ſome Chriſtians more lively, and more wakeful, and more apprehenſive than others; yet there are none but <hi>Slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;</hi> for the General Character of any Church, it falls upon particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons, in a very great meaſure.</p>
                     <p>Now I ſay, thoſe high Ecſtaſies of ſpirituality, of Heavenli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of Holineſs, of Purity, that are to be found in Scripture, make it plain, that the excellent and glorious, and powerful Spirit of Chriſtianity is in a <hi>Slumber,</hi> as in us.</p>
                     <p>And hereby, I would deſire you to take notice, That the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Kingdom of Chriſt is not, as if ſome ſenſual or Worldly Glory were to be brought in; or that men were to be pleaſed with that: For the thing that I expect, when <hi>the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of this World ſhall be proclaimed to be the Kingdoms of the Lord and of his Chriſt,</hi> are quite of another nature: That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of us are alive at that day, whether I or you, or any of us that truly love and fear him, and love the Glory of his Kingdom; I make no doubt, but the Glory and Power of Chriſtianity ſhall ſprout out afreſh upon them, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>Then the Lord awaked, as one out of ſleep, and like a mighty Man that ſhouteth by reaſon of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41902:53"/> Wine</hi> (Pſal. 78. 65, 66.) <hi>And he ſmote his enemies in the hinder parts; he put them to a perpetual reproach:</hi> So we ſhall be able to ſmite the Luſts and Corruptions, and the power of Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that now ſo prevail upon us; we ſhall be able to chaſe them, and to put them to flight, and to drive them before us. We ſhall be able to love God and Chriſt, and to be mortified to this World; we ſhall be able to expreſs our ſelves abundantly in the ways of holineſs, and to rejoice in God accordingly; and it is no other Kingdom that I expect, But all ſhall bring in this, with its happy conſequences; I ſay, we ſhall be able to lay off, and aſide from our ſelves, all the Vanity, Pride and Love of this World, and all, not only the Groſs Sins that are in the World, in regard of which, men are ſcandalous, and Chriſtians evil ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of every where, But thoſe Sins that the World doth colour and varniſh over, and ſpeak very kindly and fairly of; all the deadneſs in Hearing, in Praying and Diſcourſing. Alas! our Diſcourſe of Religion, it is but a kind of Formality; we don't retain any thing of it: But when this <hi>Slumber</hi> is taken off of Chriſtianity, it ſhall be much otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond Place, When the <hi>Slumber</hi> of Chriſtianity is taken off, we ſhall ſee much clearer Scripture-Truths, and in the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Redemption of Chriſt: All the Diſpute and Anger about theſe things will go off, for the clearneſs of things will be ſeen. And then, that Diſpute that is upon us now, concerning the Kingdom of Chriſt; Some are utter Enemies to ſuch Diſcourſes of it, even good perſons; and ſome are ready to ſcorn, and laugh it out of Countenance; and few there are that believe it, and are in the Truth of it; What is the Reaſon of this? but becauſe theſe Scriptures are not ſo cleared. And ſo, very many excellent and Eminent Servants of God, they are afriad to Diſcourſe of the Free Grace of God, and the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt without Works, leſt it ſhould make men looſe, and make men licentious; and therefore they are ſtreightning and curbing, and glancing all they can againſt ſuch Diſcourſes as theſe are. The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Spirit of Slumber</hi> is ſo much upon Chriſtians, <hi>Iſaiah 29. The Lord hath poured upon you the ſpirit of deep ſleep, and hath clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed your eyes; the Prophets, and your Rulers, the Seers hath he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. And the Viſion of all is become unto you as the words of a Book that is ſealed, which Men deliver to one that is learned, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; read this, I pray thee, and he ſaith, I cannot, for it is ſealed.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41902:54"/> And the Book is delivered to one that is not learned, ſaying, read this, I pray thee; and he ſaith, I am not learned.</hi> Now, <hi>this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of deep ſleep,</hi> I hope, is taken off from us by the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and by the clearneſs of the Goſpel, in that manner that we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it, in the main, now in the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Profeſſion; but there is a <hi>Slumber</hi> ſtill remaining: Or elſe Men would hear and learn with far greater eaſe, and in another manner Diſcourſe with one another: It will be wonderful when <hi>the Tongue of the dumb ſhall ſing,</hi> as it is ſaid in the <hi>Prophet.</hi> I am verily perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That thoſe that ſay leaſt in Religion now, there will be ſuch a change in them, by taking off the <hi>Spirit of Slumber, That the Tongue of the dumb ſhall ſing:</hi> He that knows not how to ſpeak, and is afraid to ſpeak of Religion, becauſe he thinks he has not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge enough, his <hi>Tongue ſhall ſing</hi> in Diſcourſes of the ways of God; That is, he ſhall ſpeak with great clearneſs, and great acceptableneſs.</p>
                     <p>In the Third Place; We ſhall have a greater value for the ſtate of Glory that is to be revealed, and a greater undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the preſent ſtate of this World: We ſhall not think we are undone, if we have not of this World, and of the things of it, in ſuch an abundance, as we would have.</p>
                     <p>Or, if we cannot lay ſuch foundations of Eſtates for the time to come; Men will begin to ſay, That this preſent World is like a <hi>Cottage</hi> that is <hi>ſuddenly to be removed.</hi> And if Men had foreknown, in <hi>Jamaica,</hi> ſome Days or Weeks before, that their Houſes ſhould go down (as one may ſay) ſo quick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Earth, and be ſwallowed up, and even the Earth it ſelf ſo changed, what value do you think they would have had for thoſe Houſes, or Grounds? and how many Years Purchace would they have valu'd all at as we ordinarily ſpeak? So I ſay, when our preſent ſtate is like a <hi>Cottage</hi> that is to be removed; that great value and eſteem we have of the World ſhall go off.</p>
                     <p>If you will ſay, This is only a ſort of Levelling Doctrine or Diſcourſe; I do not intend it ſhould move any one as for the preſent, but only to an expectation, and to take off our hearts from the preſent <hi>evil World:</hi> And I only deſire to tell you, what ſhall be when you ſhall ſee ſuch a Glory and Light of this World to come, appearing and ſhining out: I do but deſire that you would remember what hath been ſpoken to you out of the Word, and in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41902:54"/> what hath been ſpoken of theſe things that are to come to paſs.</p>
                     <p>I'll give you but a brief Account of the Difference between the one and the other, (the <hi>Wiſe,</hi> and <hi>Fooliſh Virgins</hi>) and ſo conclude in the Application of it. And I take it out of that <hi>5th.</hi> Chapter of <hi>Solomons-Song.</hi> Here's the great Difference that is between the one ſort, and the other ſort. <hi>Ver. 2. I Sleep</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>but my heart waketh.</hi> That is, there is a Principle within me; there is a Spirit within me: A Spirit within every <hi>Wiſe Virgin,</hi> that keeps a watch even while it is in a <hi>Slumber.</hi> As you know, many Perſons, they have a warineſs of things, though they are in a ſort of <hi>Slumber;</hi> yet they are preſently ſenſible if any thing comes, either as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, or diſadvantage.</p>
                     <p>So there is a Spirit in every true Chriſtian, that is aware of the Great Concernments of Eternity, that knows the Excellency of Chriſt, and that loves Jeſus Chriſt; and that knows the Vanity of this World, and the things of it: Even while they are in a <hi>Slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> their <hi>heart wakes</hi> concerning theſe things. And then, again, you read, They cannot be quiet, they have ſuch kind of <hi>Items</hi> and <hi>Intimations</hi> from Chriſt, that they are preſently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware: That when Chriſt ſpeaks, preſently the <hi>Beloved,</hi> the Church of Chriſt, the true Church anſwers him: (<hi>ver.</hi> 4.) Saith ſhe, <hi>My Beloved put in his hand by the hole of the Door,</hi> and <hi>my bowels were moved for him:</hi> Indeed, ſhe could not get quickly up, <hi>Indeed,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>I have put off my Coat, how ſhall I put it on?</hi> That is, I have ſet my ſelf in a way of Religion, that I hope, will do, and will be enough, and it is as much as others do; and as much as generally is to be found among Chriſtians, and as much as can ſuit with the preſent ſtate of this World; but Chriſt gave her an <hi>Intimation</hi> and <hi>Item</hi> from himſelf; And preſently, ſaith ſhe, <hi>My Bowels were moved for him; And I aroſe to open to my Belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> and then ſhe went ſeeking up and down the City: And <hi>the Watchmen ſaid,</hi> it is too much for you to take upon you; they take away <hi>her Vail from her;</hi> they impeach her Modeſty as it were: But ſhe goes on, <hi>I Charge you, O Daughters of Jeruſalem, if ye find my Beloved, that ye tell him I am ſick of love:</hi> There is an earneſt, and vehement, and inward affection in the heart, that is in every true, ſincere Chriſtian, in every <hi>wiſe Virgin; Though they ſleep, yet their heart waketh:</hi> There is a Principle and a Power, that ſhall never be deſerted and forſaken of God, even in the midſt of this inclination to <hi>Slumber:</hi> God will
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41902:55"/> bring it forth in Power, and to Perfection; and ſo you may Trace the thing along in your own ſouls: Do you find that a little <hi>Intimation</hi> makes you very earneſt and vehement after Chriſt? Do you find that there is ſuch a ſtable deſire of Chriſt, and his Grace and Spirit, That you deſire he ſhould know, that you are <hi>ſick of love?</hi> And that you declare to the World, that you love him above all things elſe.</p>
                     <p>And ſo, I ſhall proceed no further in this Diſcourſe, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cloſe with Application.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the firſt place, It teaches us, That we ſhould not mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the preſent ſtate of any Church, or Churches whatſoever, or their way; for all of them come far ſhort, though one much ſhorter than another, yet all come ſhort.</p>
                     <p>And ſo we ſhould ſee in our own ſtate: Alas! it is but ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Day, or rather (as I may ſay) to the Night that is yet continuing, and is not yet paſt off from us. Though indeed, God is exceedingly to be magnified and adored, in all the good of the Goſpel and Chriſtianity that we ſee in the World. I am far from putting a Blemiſh or Diminution upon what God hath done; ſeeing there are ſo many Excellent Preachers of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and ſo many Excellent Chriſtians; and ſuch a great Light of the Goſpel, as we have: That ſuch as were heretofore, would have wondred at the Goodneſs and Grace of God, if there ſhould have been ſuch a freedom of Preaching his Word every where, and gathering Souls to himſelf: And that there are ſo many of his Servants have a deſire towards his Name, and towards the Remembrance of him: And therefore, I ſay, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to fore-caution as to that part; That I am not at all cenſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but acknowledging of the Infinite Grace of God. But yet I ſay ſtill, That I would not have you think, we are at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Chriſtianity, as it is in Publick, or as it is in Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars: I make no doubt, but he that fears God now, ſhall fear him much more; and he that loves Chriſt now, ſhall love him much more; and they that ſpeak and think of his Name, ſhall do it much more, when <hi>this Slumber</hi> is taken off: I tell you, you cannot do now what you would do; you cannot love God and Chriſt; you cannot be ſo free, and undiſtracted, and retired in to the way of Chriſtianity, as you would be. And therefore look upon it, That the preſent Day is the Day of the <hi>Slumber</hi> of the Glory of Chriſtianity; and therefore, let us bewail our
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41902:55"/> ſelves, that we can get up no higher awakened: much more, that we cannot ſhake off that <hi>Slumber</hi> that is ſo much upon us.</p>
                     <p>But ſtill I ſay, we muſt expect a clearer, and lightſomer, and a brighter Air of the Goſpel, and Sun-ſhine of it: We muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect <hi>the Sun of Righteouſneſs with healing in his Wings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Do but conſider how you come on upon a Duty, and how you come off; and how you loſe what you would retain; and how hard it is to gain, and how quickly it is gone off.</p>
                     <p>Our ſouls ſhould be in a conſtant poſture in this World; our Veſſels for ordinary uſes, ſhould be <hi>Holineſs to Jehovah;</hi> but if one Treats of this way, or that way, one finds, that the Glory of it does not ſparkle and gliſter as it ſhould, I ſpeak not what I ſpeak from my own ſpirit, but what God will ſpeedily make good to all thoſe that ſhall live in that Time, Then they ſhall ſay, <hi>How hath the Glory of Chriſtianity changed me!</hi> We ſhall find the Vacancies and the Emptineſſes and Blemiſhes that are upon us, ſhall be fill'd up, and taken off; and we ſhall walk in a higher Power and Spirit of Chriſtianity: And therefore let no one boaſt, in regard of this or that Church-State, whatſoever it be; For certainly, All is under a <hi>Spirit of Slumber</hi> now; and there ſhall come a far more excellent State upon the Churches of Chriſt; and ſo it ſhall deſcend upon every particular Perſon. And then,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In the Second Place, Let us earneſtly aſpire to this ſtate in our ſelves; as <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>I will not give Sleep to my eyes, nor Slumber to my Eye-lids, till I make an Habitation for the God of Jacob,</hi> So let us aſpire now, as high as we can; and let us earneſtly deſire this Glory of the Kingdom of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ſhall awaken us as a Man is <hi>awakened out of ſleep,</hi> as the expreſſion is in the Prophet.</p>
                     <p>For, I am perſwaded, God will awaken all his Servants, as one <hi>is awakened out of Sleep;</hi> And therefore, let us earneſtly long for that Time. And whatever God is doing, or ſeems to do in the World, let us obſerve what <hi>Tendencies</hi> it has to this Excellent State of the Kingdom of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and then this. <hi>Slumber</hi> ſhall be perfectly taken off. And then,</p>
                     <p n="3">3, In the Third and laſt place; Let it comfort us exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly in God, and in Chriſt: And let us ſay, The Things that God hath prepared and deſigned, they are Things <hi>That Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, nor have entred into the heart of man
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41902:56"/> to conceive.</hi> For that in the 64th of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> is to be applied to the Coming of Chriſt. <hi>O that thou wouldeſt Rent the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and that thou wouldeſt come down; and that the Mountains might flow down at thy Preſence. As when the melting fire burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the fire cauſeth the Waters to boil,</hi> &amp;c. And then (ſaith he) <hi>Things that Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, yet he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for him that waiteth for him. Since the beginning of the World, Men have not heard, nor perceived by the Ear, neither hath the Eye ſeen, O God, beſides thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Conſider it at your own Freedom; This State is near com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth; ſuch an one, as hath not been ſeen, or heard of ſince the Foundation of the World: In which, we ſhall no longer complain, at the rate we do now; That all our <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſes are as filthy Rags,</hi> and <hi>That our Iniquities like the Wind, take us away:</hi> And <hi>That we do not ſtir up our ſelves to take hold of God:</hi> But then there ſhall be a General Stirring up of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to take hold of the Lord our God.</p>

                     <p>I Have in ſeveral Diſcourſes, endeavoured to expreſs to you the Divine Senſe and Meaning of our Lord in this Parable, who (as I told you) <hi>Opened his Mouth in Parables;</hi> and in this <hi>Parable,</hi> in a very Eminent Manner; and hath <hi>made known things hid from the very Foundation of the World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Points that I have already Diſcourſed, it may be neceſſary to give you only juſt a Remembrance of; and to come to that, that is now to be propoſed: The firſt was this.</p>
                     <p>That the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> in all the motions, in all the parts, in all the Dates and Times of it, is the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is not to be looked upon, as an Earthly or a Senſual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:41902:56"/>
                     <p>In the ſecond Place,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That True Chriſtianity is an Eſpouſal unto Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> The Scripture hath delighted to ſet it forth under the Reſemblance of Marriage and Eſpouſals.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>That all the Eye of a Christian is, not to the preſent ſtate,</hi> (though it be neceſſary in the way) <hi>but it is to the future, and to the higher ſtate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For, as I opened to you out of the Old Teſtament, it was the Command of God; That there ſhould be a Contract between the Perſon that had taken a <hi>Beautiful Woman Captive,</hi> and her that was taken <hi>Captive,</hi> if he deſired to Marry her; There was to be a time of Contract; <hi>Thirty Days</hi> God did preciſely appoint; That it might ſhadow to us, That the preſent ſtate is but a ſtate of our <hi>Eſpouſals and Contract.</hi> And therefore, our chief Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Great Eye of the Soul, muſt be to the Solemnity and the Glory of the Nuptials of the Marriage it ſelf; <hi>The Virgins took their Lamps</hi> therefore, <hi>and went forth to meet the Bridegroom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Fourth Place, I opened to you, the great Solemnity.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>That notwithſtanding the Death, and Reſurrection, and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention of Chriſt into Glory; there is a great Delay of his coming.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And though this ſeems very ſtrange and unreaſonable it ſhould be ſo; I endeavoured to open to you the Reaſon that Scripture hath given, why it is ſo.</p>
                     <p>In the Sixth Place, in the laſt Diſcourſe, I opened to you this, <hi>What a Drouſie, and Sleepy ſtate of Chriſtianity hath come upon Chriſtians, and upon the Profeſſion of Chriſt, by reaſon of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom's tarrying.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall now go on to ſpeak of this, <hi>viz. At Midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the Bridgroom cometh, Go ye out to meet him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have conſidered, and weighed the Parable in all the parts of it in all the Scope of it; and I cannot find that it can relate to any thing, but to the very Glory of the Coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. For, immediately, it comes to this; <hi>That the Door was ſhut:</hi> They that were <hi>ready,</hi> went in with him to the <hi>Wedding,</hi> and <hi>the Door was ſhut.</hi> Chriſt profeſt to them without, when once the <hi>Door was ſhut; I know you not.</hi> And there is no ſuch thing as that, before the great coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And therefore this <hi>Cry at Midnight,</hi> is no other, than that which the Apoſtle ſpeaks, in the 1. <hi>Theſs. 4. 16. For the Lord himſelf ſhall
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41902:57"/> deſcend from Heaven with a ſhout, with the Voice of the Archangel, and with the Trump of God: and the Dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt.</hi> This is the great <hi>Cry</hi> that ſhall be made, it ſhall be the <hi>Cry</hi> at the Trump of the <hi>Archangel,</hi> the Voice of the <hi>Archangel.</hi> And ſo in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. The Apoſtle ſpeaks the very ſame thing, that it ſhould come to this; There ſhould be an immediate <hi>Raiſing of the Dead.</hi> Ver. 52. <hi>In a Moment, in the twinkling of an Eye,</hi> at <hi>the laſt Trump (for the Trumpet ſhall Sound</hi>) and <hi>the Dead ſhall be raiſed Incorruptible,</hi> and <hi>we ſhall be Changed.</hi> This therefore is the <hi>Midnight-Cry,</hi> Indeed, there may be ſome Reſemblances of it, by ſudden Judgments, and by ſudden Affrightments upon the World, As we may eaſily Apprehend, of late, at <hi>Jamaica,</hi> It was to them like a <hi>Day of Judgment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſay, It muſt needs be like to ſuch a <hi>Midnight-Cry,</hi> when an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſtroak of God came upon them; A Thundring, and Lightning, and an Opening of the Earth, and a Riſing up (as it were) of the <hi>Sea,</hi> to ſweep down the Inhabitants into it ſelf, this looked Juſt like the end of the World.</p>
                     <p>And though God gave us a little Item of ſuch a thing, though it did not ſo come upon us, as that beyond the Sea; yet we may eaſily Conſider, it might have been like a Mid-night, if God had done with us as he did with them.</p>
                     <p>But yet ſtill, this would not have been that <hi>Midnight-Cry,</hi> but even to thoſe that are gone down into the Depth, in that place: Yet ſtill there remains a <hi>Midnight-Cry</hi> that ſhall awaken them.</p>
                     <p>'Twas like a <hi>Midnight-Cry</hi> upon <hi>Sodom,</hi> when it was from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Conſumed by Fire: But yet, it is very evident, that <hi>Midnight-Cry</hi> remains ſtill to come, upon that very <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorah.</hi> And therefore I ſay, Though I allow Alluſions to ſuch a Scripture as this, when any Judgment that has been, or may be is ſet out to us; there may be an Alluſion to it, even as the Scripture bears us out by its Authority to do ſo. but yet, I ſay to you, That it is very certain, That the <hi>Midnight-Cry</hi> remains to thoſe, that have been under ſuch a <hi>Midnight-Cry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Saith Chriſt, <hi>Mat. 10. 15. It ſhall be more Tolerable for the Land of</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah <hi>in the day of Judgment, than for that City,</hi> You ſee here, <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> are to be under the <hi>Cry</hi> of the Day of Judgment.</p>
                     <p>And ſo I ſay, Thoſe under that Judgment lately in that <hi>Colony</hi> that part of this Nation, though beyond the Sea, there remains
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41902:57"/> ſtill, and they are bound under the expectation, and waiting for a <hi>Midnight-Cry;</hi> though they have had ſuch a one already upon them. And, if ſuch a Judgment ſhould come upon this City, or this Nation, that would not excuſe any that were ſwallowed up; but they muſt expect ſuch a <hi>Midnight-Cry</hi> to come upon them.</p>
                     <p>And, this I deſire you to take notice of, That it may open to you, and inform you of this <hi>Midnight-Cry.</hi> Whoſoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall go down into the Grave before the Coming of Jeſus Chriſt; you muſt lie down with this aſſurance, this certainty; That though you go never ſo quiet to the Grave, though you are conducted to thoſe Lodgings and Apartments of Death, with never ſo much order, and with never ſo much ſilence; yet there muſt be a <hi>Midnight-Cry</hi> to awake you out of thoſe Graves; every one of us muſt be awakened by the <hi>Midnight-Cry,</hi> and all that have gone before us, muſt awake, by this <hi>Midnight-Cry; Ariſe every one, and go forth to meet the Bridegroom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now this is the Point therefore, that I ſhall endeavour to open to you, concerning the Caſe and Condition that perſons ſhall be in, when they are awakened thus of a ſudden: For I told you, thoſe <hi>Slumbrings</hi> expreſs the <hi>Drowſie State</hi> of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that is even now; but this <hi>ſleeping</hi> properly expreſſeth Death; And the <hi>Midnight-Cry</hi> that awakens out of that ſleep, it is that <hi>Trump of God,</hi> and that <hi>Shout</hi> and <hi>Voice</hi> of the <hi>Arch-Angel:</hi> And that will be a <hi>Cry</hi> indeed, and ſo ſhrill, that no Grave can hide, or remove us from it; but it ſhall certainly ſound in the Ears of the Dead, that they ſhall preſently, at that very Summons, at that very Cry, they ſhall riſe up immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and whether they will or no, They muſt <hi>go forth and meet the Bridegroom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall therefore propoſe to Diſcourſe this Point:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That in the very ſame circumſtances</hi> (pray conſider) <hi>that any of us lie down in the Grave; in the very ſame we muſt be awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up again; We muſt be called out of the Grave, in the very ſame State.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whoever has gone out of this preſent World, a Believer in Jeſus Chriſt, a truly repenting perſon, a ſanctified and juſtified perſon, as ſuch, they ſhall riſe at that <hi>Cry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And they that have gone out in their ſins, in their Luſts, in their Impurity, in their falſe profeſſion of Chriſtianity; in that very ſame condition they muſt riſe again.</p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:41902:58"/>
                     <p>The <hi>Virgins</hi> that were <hi>wiſe,</hi> they riſe <hi>wiſe Virgins</hi> at the <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night Cry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the <hi>Virgins</hi> that were <hi>fooliſh;</hi> they are not mended by all that time that they have ſpent; either their Bodies in the Grave, or their Spirits in what ſtate ſoever, but they riſe <hi>fooliſh Virgins:</hi> For ſo you ſee here, (<hi>ver. 8.) The Virgins all aroſe, and trimmed their Lamps, and the fooliſh ſaid,</hi> the <hi>fooliſh</hi> were <hi>fooliſh</hi> ſtill; and they <hi>ſaid unto the wiſe,</hi> for the <hi>wiſe</hi> were <hi>wiſe</hi> ſtill.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall therefore Endeavour to make this Point as plain to you, and as forceable as I can, by way of Practice and Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon us, to look well about us, and to conſider what our State and Condition is, becauſe we ſhall riſe the very ſame that we lie down.</p>
                     <p>And therefore I ſhall lay it out in theſe Heads of Diſcourſe:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, I ſhall open to you, That thoſe that riſe at that <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night-Cry,</hi> They ſhall certainly preſently know, what their State and Condition is; and yet notwithſtanding that (which is the great wonder of the thing) they ſhall ſo act, and they ſhall ſo endeavour to demean themſelves, in mending their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, wherein they lay down, as this Parable repreſents, and yet ſhall not be able to do it. This indeed, may ſeem very won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, as I ſhall endeavour to open to you. And then,</p>
                     <p>In the Second place, I ſhall ſhew you how every perſon ſhall riſe in ſuch a kind of circumſtance, like one that hears the <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night-Cry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But more particularly, I ſhall open this in a <hi>Fooliſh Virgin</hi> ſtate; that is, in a State wherein we ſeem to be truly Chriſtians, we hope ſo of our ſelves, and others hope ſo of us, and yet we are not ſo.</p>
                     <p>And, I ſhall open to you, what a kind of ſtruggle there will be, notwithſtanding ſuch <hi>fooliſh Virgins</hi> muſt needs know their State in the main; yet the thing will be adminiſtred by God in ſuch a marvellous manner, That they ſhall endeavour to mend and to change the diſadvantage of their preſent Circumſtances. And then, I ſhall conclude with Application.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Therefore, I ſhall begin with this; That Every perſon, at that <hi>Midnight-Cry,</hi> muſt needs preſently know his own State, his own condition, with relation to Happineſs or Miſery; And This I ſhall open to you, in theſe three Evidences or Arguments, That every perſon muſt needs at that <hi>Mid-night-Cry,</hi> immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41902:58"/> know and diſcover what their State and Condition is.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The firſt Argument or Evidence of it is this; Becauſe the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a Man comes to the riſing of the Body, with the Notices, and with the Impreſſions of what State it hath been in, from the time of Death, to the time of that Reſurrection.</p>
                     <p>The Spirit of a Man, I ſay, that hath gone out of the Body, it comes full of the ſence of that ſtate and condition, wherein it hath been in all that time: For, there is not ſuch a kind of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion, or forgetfulneſs, or ſlumber upon the Spirit, by being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united to the Body, that it does not know, nor underſtand the caſe, or the condition, that it hath been in all that time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dives</hi> indeed, in Hell, knew his own State and Condition; but it may be ſuppoſed, That when a Spirit hath been out of the Body, when it comes into the Body again, it only knows what it was in the Body, when it left the Body, and not what the State and Condition hath been all along ſince it left the Body. But we ſhould conſider, when the Scripture ſpeaks theſe things, we have great reaſon to believe, as I ſhall ſhew you, theſe Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſeem ſo diſpoſed, that we may underſtand, men ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to change their circumſtances then, yet for all that, they come under apprehenſions of that ſtate and condition they have been in all along.</p>
                     <p>And therefore (<hi>John</hi> 5. 28.) our Saviour ſeems to ſpeak, that they do (as it were) come right forward into the ſtate of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation that have done evil.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Marvel not at this, for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the Graves ſhall hear his voice, and ſhall come forth, they that have done good, unto the reſurrection of life, and they that have done evil, unto the reſurrection of damnation.</hi> They come imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately forth, each to their own ſtate; that ſtate wherein they have been ſince Death, and at Death: So <hi>Dan. 12. 1, 2. There ſhall be a time of great trouble: And many of them that ſleep in the duſt of the Earth, ſhall awake, ſome to everlaſting life, and ſome to ſhame and everlaſting contempt.</hi> For the Spirits that have been with God and Chriſt, they come with the bleſſed aſſurances of that ſtate and condition: And they that have been in Chains of Darkneſs to the <hi>Judgment of the Great Day,</hi> under the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that, they come under the <hi>Judgment of eternal fire;</hi> as the expreſſion is, in the Apoſtles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Jude.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Every one, They come (as it were) breathing, and carrying
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41902:59"/> upon them, the favour, the odour of that ſtate and condition wherein they have been.</p>
                     <p>The Spirit of a Man knows its own ſtate, even when it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns into the Body: And there is this great Scripture that doth aſſure us, if you ſhould think, that what I have already given, doth not riſe up to the very Point, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. You ſhall ſee in what manner all come forth at that day, <hi>They ſhew the work of the Law written in their hearts, their Conſcience alſo bearing witneſs, and their thoughts, the mean while, accuſing, or elſe excuſing one another: in the day</hi> (obſerve that) <hi>in the day when God ſhall judge the ſecrets of Men by Jeſus Chriſt, according to my Goſpel:</hi> Here's the manner in which they come forth in that day; they come with <hi>Thoughts</hi> either <hi>accuſing</hi> or <hi>excuſing:</hi> And then (ſaith the Apoſtle) is the time when there is that vigorous Accuſation or Excuſation of Conſcience; it is in the day <hi>when God ſhall judge the ſecrets of Men by Jeſus Christ, according to my Goſpel:</hi> So that Men riſe, even in that <hi>Midnight-Cry,</hi> when they come into Bodies, with <hi>Thoughts</hi> full, either of <hi>Accuſation</hi> or <hi>Excuſation;</hi> They come with all their <hi>Thoughts</hi> about them, they do not leave their <hi>Thoughts</hi> either in Heaven or in Hell; but they come with <hi>Thoughts</hi> either <hi>accuſing</hi> or <hi>excuſing.</hi> That's the firſt Argument.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond Argument is this, They know in what Company they come, and whether they are in the Glorious and Bleſſed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany or not: For it is very evident, the Saints come together with Chriſt; and therefore they are aſſured, becauſe they know the Company they come along with: So in 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>The dead in Chriſt, God will bring them with him:</hi> So they come with Chriſt; they know that they come in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and they are aſſured.</p>
                     <p>There is a great deal of difference (you know) between thoſe that come along with the Judge, and make a part of his Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Retinue and Attendance, and thoſe that come out of Priſon, and behold the Face of the Judge, as ſitting in Judgment upon them, 1 <hi>Theſ. 4. 14, 15. For if we believe that Jeſus died, and roſe again, Them alſo which ſleep in Jeſus, will God bring with him. For we ſay unto you by the Word of the Lord, that we which are alive, and remain unto the Coming of the Lord, ſhall not prevent them which are aſleep:</hi> They ſhall certainly come with Jeſus Chriſt; And ſo, <hi>Zach. 14. 5. The Lord my God ſhall come, and all the Saints with thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:41902:59"/>
                     <p>They come in the Glory of the Company of Jeſus Chriſt. And this our Saviour calls, a <hi>Being ſet at the Right Hand.</hi> It is the very ſame thing with that, <hi>Mat.</hi> the 25. He <hi>ſhall ſet the Goats on the Left Hand,</hi> and <hi>the Sheep on the Right;</hi> That is, they come with him on his <hi>Right Hand.</hi> And in that Scripture, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. It is ſaid, <hi>The Heavens opened unto Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and <hi>the Armies which were in Heaven, they follow him on White horſes.</hi> Ver. 11. <hi>And I ſaw Heaven opened, and beheld a White-horſe, and he that ſat upon him was called Faithful and True: His Eyes were as a flame of Fire.</hi> Ver. 12. And it is ſaid, <hi>The Armies which were in Heaven followed him upon White-Horſes:</hi> Ver. 14. That is, <hi>The Saints in Bodies of Glory;</hi> For the <hi>White Horſes,</hi> and the <hi>Fine Linnen White and Clean,</hi> that are there named, mean the Glory of the Saints, in Bodies of the Reſurrection. On the other ſide, the Wicked, they come Aloof; they come no near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, nor no faſter than they muſt needs; they are forced and called for, as Priſoners in Chains and Fetters muſt come, that are brought: And ſo they muſt come in this way, Sinners and Wicked Perſons, that have not Repented nor Believed in Jeſus Chriſt; that have not the <hi>White Horſes to Ride upon,</hi> and the <hi>Fine Linnen White and Clean</hi> to be Arrayed in. And it brings in,</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Third</hi> thing. For, the very Bodies, the very Cloaths, that the one and the other will have on, do enough aſſure them, exactly what they are, whether the Saved, or the Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; whether the Happy or the Unhappy: I ſay, The gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wherewith they are Cloathed. For, while Saints have <hi>Linnen White and Clean;</hi> the Wicked, they are Dark and Duskie, they are in Priſon-Cloaths, and Priſon-Raggs, they have Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters about them: They know by that, as well as Men know by theit Garb, what the State and Condition of one another is. Now this I look upon, to give the Reaſon to that Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. Juſt when Chriſt is coming, he ſaid, Juſt at the very time when he is coming (Ver. 15.) <hi>Behold, I come as a Thief; Bleſſed is he that Watcheth, and keepeth his Garments leſt he walk naked,</hi> and <hi>they ſee his ſhame.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bleſſed is he that watcheth,</hi> &amp;c. That is, <hi>Bleſſed</hi> is he that looks well to it, that when he riſes again, he may have a Robe of Immortality; That he may have a Garment ſuitable to that State, Suitable to the Glory and Excellency of that Time.</p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:41902:60"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bleſſed is he that watcheth,</hi> and <hi>keepeth his Garments;</hi> hath ſo taken care, to lay off the Cloathing of the Body; that when he comes into it again, it may inſtead of all the Darkneſs and Corruption, In which it lay down, it may be a Body of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; a Body Incorruptible, as it is ſaid, in the 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 52. The Dead ſhall be raiſed Incorruptible. They ſhall be Raiſed,</hi> He ſpeaks evidently of the Saints of Chriſt, They ſhall be raiſed in a moment <hi>Incorruptible.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And that's the firſt thing that I have laid down and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to Argue to you; The time of Chriſts coming, That will be the time, when that <hi>Midnight-Cry</hi> ſhall be, and that when we ſhall be in the firſt hearing of it, and come forth, we ſhall know in what ſtate and condition we are.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> By the Notices given to us from our Spirits, from our <hi>Thoughts</hi> Accuſing, or Excuſing at that very time, in that very day. And then,</p>
                     <p>Again, from the Company we are in; whether we come with Chriſt, or whether we are thoſe that are brought before him, whether we will or no. And then,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By that Habit of Body, wherein we ſhall be; either a <hi>Body of Glory,</hi> or a <hi>Body of Shame</hi> and <hi>Contempt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And yet, notwithſtanding This, which is the wonder of the Thing: and I confeſs, after my utmoſt thoughts and enquiry into it, I cannot ſatisfie my ſelf how it ſhould be: That not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, Men are juſt in the ſame Circumſtances where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they lay down, and as if the Day of Judgment had taken them then, in the State and Condition that they had been in in the World, that which was their Prevalent, and their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, and their Final State, that which truely gave them their Denomination.</p>
                     <p>Now, I ſhall only give you this Account of it; though indeed I do not know how: It is a Wonder of the mighty Wiſdom and the mighty power of God, that a man ſhould ſo riſe; That theſe <hi>Fooliſh Virgins</hi> muſt have notice, that they are <hi>Fooliſh Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,</hi> by what I now Argue to you; and that yet they ſhould Endeavour to make the beſt of their Condition,</p>
                     <p>And I would do it in a word or two, becauſe I would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe the Point of the <hi>Fooliſh Virgins,</hi> eſpecially to you at this time, and according to this Parable. Suppoſe a Man be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Swearer, a common Drunkard, a common Impure, Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41902:60"/> Perſon, a Perſon that lives in Debauchery: This Man, ſuppoſe ſuch an one die without having repented, and having returned to God, or the change of his courſe: This Perſon ſhall riſe, he ſhall riſe in all the horrour of ſuch a ſtate when Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment comes upon him: However, Men will not be perſwaded of it now, or be brought to abhor or change ſuch an inſolent way of life, as they live in, nor will conſider it now; yet they ſhall be raiſed in circumſtances ſuitable to that very ſtate in which they died.</p>
                     <p>As now, ſuppoſe a Man ſhould be taken in an Earthquake, or by ſuch a Judgment as they in <hi>Jamaica,</hi> or any other place; and that he was ſenſible of it a little before, what a danger he was in, and that it ſhould come upon him while he was in his Cups, and Roar of Prophaneneſs; when he was ſcoffing and laughing at Religion; What do you think ſuch a Perſon would do, if he had but a little notice of it before? I'll give you a plain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation what a Caſe ſuch a Perſon would be in, by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame Caſe, by a precedent (as I may properly call it) that hath been before. If you look therefore into <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. you ſhall find the very ſame Caſe, <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> (ver. 1.) <hi>made a great Feaſt to a Thouſand of his Lords: And they brought the Golden and Silver Veſſels, and they drank Wine, and Praiſed the Gods of Gold and of Silver,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>In the ſame hour came forth Fingers of a Mans Hand, and wrote over againſt the Candleſtick, upon the Plaiſter of the Wall of the Kings Palace, and the King ſaw part of the Hand that wrote. Then the Kings Countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, ſo that the Joints of his Loins were looſed, and his Knees ſmote one againſt the other.</hi> This is the very caſe of ſuch Perſons.</p>
                     <p>I may boldly pronounce it in the Name of Chriſt, and in the Word of the Goſpel, and of Truth; Look upon your Swaggerers, and thoſe that make nothing to ſcorn Religion; That make a <hi>Scoff at Sin;</hi> That never open their Mouths, but with an Oath, or in a Blaſphemy; That theſe very Perſons, ſuppoſing they die in this State, and with theſe Sins unrepented of, They ſhall riſe in the very ſame, and with the horrour of Judgment on them. They ſhall ſee (as it were) <hi>the Fingers upon the Wall;</hi> and their <hi>Joints ſhall be looſed, and their Knees ſmite one againſt another: They'll ſay to the Rocks, Fall on us, and to the Mountains, hide and cover us: Diſtreſs and Anguiſh ſhall come upon them,</hi> as it is ſaid, <hi>Prov. 1. It ſhall come like a Whirlwind: Then
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41902:61"/> ſhall they call upon me, and I will not anſwer.</hi> Men that ſcorn and ſcoff at Religion now, they ſhall be forced then to cry, but they ſhall not find God; But then <hi>I'll laugh</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>at their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, and mock when their fear cometh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the ſecond Place, Take a covetous Worldling, that does not ſo much as think there is any thing more, but to look well to this World, and he guilds his Covetouſneſs over with ſo much Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as is neceſſary for his preſent Concernment, to ſecure him from any thing of danger: I ſay, he keeps all his Worldlineſs within compaſs, with ſomething of Religion; but he does not really conſider what a great ſtate, a ſtate of Eternity is, and what a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, the preſent ſtate of the World is.</p>
                     <p>Now, would you know in what a Caſe ſuch a Man ſhall riſe in? He ſhall riſe in an amaze, and ſay, I never thought of the World to come, I thought of the preſent World; I knew how ill it would be with my Family, if I did not take care of that; but never thought of the other World; I had ſo much Silver and Gold, and Fruits of the Earth laid up for many years, and ſaid, <hi>Take thine eaſe, my Soul, Eat, Drink and be Merry;</hi> and he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conſidered the greatneſs of this Eternal Condition.</p>
                     <p>Now, Obſerve what Chriſt ſpeaks <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 19. when he ſaid, <hi>Soul, Take thine Eaſe, Eat, Drink and be Merry, for thou haſt much Goods laid up for many years: Then God ſaid to him, Thou Fool! This Night ſhall thy Soul be required of thee: And then, whoſe ſhall theſe things be which thou haſt provided? So is he that layeth up Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and is not rich towards God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I never thought (ſaith this Senſualiſt) of ſuch a thing as that, this was a ſtrange Notion in my life-time; a Notion, that I did not know how to underſtand, or to think it any thing but Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and meer Diſcourſe; but now I find what it is, not <hi>to be rich towards God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And ſo I ſay, By theſe two Perſons, I have briefly ſet out to you, what the Circumſtances ſhall be in which Men ſhall riſe that have not minded God and their Eternal Condition.</p>
                     <p>But, according to the Subject that is before me, I ſhall open to you, eſpecially, the <hi>Fooliſh Virgins,</hi> that we may all take care; for it is indeed, a very nice Caſe; I ſay, a very nice Caſe; That a Man ſhould be a <hi>Virgin;</hi> that any Perſon ſhould be a <hi>Virgin</hi> in the account of Jeſus Chriſt; and yet, becauſe he is a <hi>fooliſh Virgin</hi> he is utterly undone: That is a <hi>Virgin,</hi> that hath the Truth
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41902:61"/> of Religion, that hath the Truth of Doctrine, the Truth of Worſhip, and he muſt needs be ſuppoſed to be a Perſon of a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber outward Converſation; or elſe, he could not deſerve the Name or Appearance, or Stile of a <hi>Virgin;</hi> He muſt not be a Swearer, Drunkard or Unclean Perſon; He muſt not be one that wallows, or tumbles in evil; for who would call ſuch an one (with relation to God and Religion) <hi>a Virgin?</hi> And yet, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, becauſe he is a <hi>fooliſh Virgin,</hi> all the Miſery here expreſt, comes upon him.</p>
                     <p>Let us therefore conſider our ſelves; I would hope, That we might have a very good Title and Pretenſion to this Stile of a <hi>Virgin;</hi> and that we hold the Truth of the Goſpel, and the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Worſhip, and the Holineſs of Converſation, in regard of all outward Appearance; and yet, let us look well to this, That we are not <hi>Fools</hi> therein: And therefore, I'll ſet out to you, in ſeveral particulars, according to the Wiſdom of our Lord Jeſus, in this Parable: I'll ſhew you the danger of being a <hi>fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Virgin,</hi> and in what kind of Circumſtances they ſhall riſe, and how it ſhall be with them (as it were) from firſt to laſt; as our Lord hath here given to us, and yet I'll do it with brevity; for the things will be very plain: And if we would be but faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to our ſelves, in taking notice of them, and laying them up in our hearts, and examining our hearts according to them; There needs not much to be ſaid, but thought and conſidered, and meditated upon much by every one of us, in relation to each particular.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt thing which expreſſes the circumſtances in which <hi>fooliſh Virgins</hi> ſhall ariſe, is this,</p>
                     <p>They will preſently begin to make the beſt of that Name of Profeſſion, and that Name <hi>Virginity</hi> that hath been upon them: They'll be ready to ſay, I have had a Lamp; I carry that to be ſure with me, I have had a Name of Profeſſion and Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon me: I have Endeavoured to Hear and to Pray, and to Receive the Lords Supper, and to keep the Lord's Day: I'll be certain to take that along with me; for all the <hi>Virgins aroſe, and Trimmed their Lamps.</hi> The <hi>wiſe</hi> indeed had Right to do it, and they did it upon good grounds, and the <hi>fooliſh</hi> did the very ſame thing, and therefore it is ſignificantly expreſt in the Text; <hi>All thoſe Virgins,</hi> not only <hi>wiſe</hi> but <hi>fooliſh, They aroſe and Trimmed their Lamps:</hi> That is, they ſet out their Profeſſion
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41902:62"/> as large, and as favourable, and with as much advantage as they could.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore, Here is our great Point, to look to this, That we have not only the <hi>Lamp</hi> of Profeſſion; but that we have the Truth and Sincerity of Faith and Repentance, of Holineſs, of an Intereſt in Chriſt, and in his Bloud: I'll give you two Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to this caſe, one on the ſide of the <hi>wiſe Virgins,</hi> and one on the ſide of the <hi>fooliſh Virgins,</hi> and ſo paſs on. And I would deſire you would take notice of theſe Scriptures, that may be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to bring theſe things to your Minds; That all of us may enter into deep Reflection, and ſerious Examination upon it. In the 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 22. ſaith the Apoſtle (ſpeaking of theſe things) <hi>ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ye have purified your ſouls in obeying the Truth through the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, unto unfeigned love of the Brethren,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Being born again, not of corruptible ſeed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God;</hi> and, now obſerve how he had Diſcourſed of this Point before (<hi>ver. 17.) And if ye call on the Father, who without reſpect of perſons judgeth according to every mans work, paſs the time of your ſojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here in fear.</hi> In what <hi>fear</hi> does he mean? not in a ſlaviſh <hi>fear</hi> (as I ſhall ſhew you preſently) but in a holy care, in a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly awe, in a wiſe and judicious ſearch into things; and ſo he ſpeaks (<hi>ver. 7.) That the Tryal of your Faith being much more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than of Gold that periſheth, though it be tried with Fire, might be found unto Praiſe and Honour and Glory at the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> O let every one take this Scripture into Mind, into ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſideration, and <hi>paſs the time of our ſojourning here,</hi> in a holy, and wiſe, and judicious <hi>Awe</hi> and <hi>Fear:</hi> That the <hi>Tryal of our Faith, though it be tryed with Fire,</hi> &amp;c. Obſerve how nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the Apoſtle ſpeaks, as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>Your Faith will be tryed with Fire,</hi> with the <hi>Fire of that Day,</hi> whether it be true and right Faith or not; And it will be tryed in a moment, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, becauſe a <hi>ſhort work will the Lord make upon the Earth.</hi> For (as I told you) it will appear preſently, by the <hi>Thoughts</hi> we have about us, by the <hi>Company</hi> we come with, by the <hi>Bodies</hi> we have on; And this will be in the Face of the <hi>Fire</hi> you muſt come; and if it be only a <hi>droſſy-Faith,</hi> it won't ſtand the <hi>Fire;</hi> it won't be able to endure: If it be only a <hi>painted Faith,</hi> it will preſently come to nothing: And (therefore ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) look that your <hi>Faith be found to Honour, and Glory, and Praiſe at the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:41902:62"/>
                     <p>And then, on the Side of the <hi>Fooliſh Virgins;</hi> Conſider That in the 13th Chapter of <hi>Luke 26. Then ſhall ye begin to ſay, We have eaten and drunk in thy Preſence, and thou haſt taught in our ſtreets. They ſhall begin to ſay; when they</hi> find <hi>the Door ſhut upon them, They ſhall begin to ſay, Lord, We have Eat and Drunk in thy Preſence, and thou haſt taught in our ſtreets. But he ſhall ſay, I tell you, I know you not whence you are; depart from me all ye workers of iniquity,</hi> ver. 24. <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate, for many, I ſay unto you, ſhall ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I expound it <hi>Eſpecially</hi> (though I don't deny, that at this time, there are ſome Half-ſeekers that cannot enter) But it is eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at that time, <hi>of the coming of the Bridegroom; They ſhall ſeek to enter, and they ſhall not be able. When once the Maſter of the Houſe is riſen up, and hath ſhut the Door,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Then ſhall ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſay, We have eaten and drunk in thy preſence, and thou haſt taught in our ſtreets.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So here's the Firſt thing; they endeavour to make the beſt of their profeſſion, that they have had here in the World. So will all <hi>fooliſh Virgins</hi> do in all their Duties, of all that they have ſaid for God, or any good works; but If the power of theſe things have not been, it will not be able to carry any out, though we ſhall endeavour to make the beſt of our Profeſſion; that's the firſt Deſcription of the State of the <hi>fooliſh Virgins,</hi> when they <hi>aroſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. I come to the Second thing that our Lord here mentions, And that is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They ſhall preſently be ſenſible</hi> (pray obſerve that) <hi>that their Grace doth not hold out, that they were but counterfeit, that they were but droſs, that they were but Tinſel:</hi> For preſently they ſay, they want ſupply, <hi>Give us of your Oil, for our Lamps are gone out:</hi> It is a ſad and woful thing, That a Man ſhould loſe all the Prayers, and all the Profeſſion that he made here in the World: And yet, when he comes into his Body again, though he was ſent out of the World with Prayers and Duties (I don't ſpeak to diſcourage you in any of theſe things, but to provoke you to it, to look to the Life, and to the Power) preſently ſay, <hi>My Lamp is gone out;</hi> all my Hearing and Praying is come to nothing, they did not go down to the root, to the bottom of my Heart and Life, they are become nothing, <hi>Our Lamps are gone out:</hi> This is ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the expreſſion we read in the <hi>Proverbs:</hi> It is ſaid, that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41902:63"/> 
                        <hi>the Lamp of the wicked ſhall be put out in obſcure darkneſs.</hi> O how great will that <hi>Darkneſs</hi> be, when that <hi>Light that is in us,</hi> ſhall be plainly found, and felt, and perceived to be <hi>Darkneſs!</hi> O what a miſerable thing is it, when a Man ſhall be forced to ſay, All my Religion and Profeſſion, it is gone out, it is a <hi>Lamp gone out! Our Lamps are gone out:</hi> It is a moſt hideous Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the thing, as could be made: <hi>We walked in the Light of our Lamps,</hi> when we were here in the World; And now, when all comes to the Tryal of the <hi>Day,</hi> and <hi>of the fire,</hi> when it comes to be Examined, indeed, <hi>Our Lamps are gone out.</hi> Juſt as if a Man were entring into ſome dark Vault; as you know, Miners, they go with <hi>Lights,</hi> and as ſoon as they come into the dark and black of the Vapours, their Lights preſently go out, and they know not which way to go, nor how to guide themſelves: And ſo in that Day, it will be a very lamentable and terrible ſtate to us, to be forced to ſay, That <hi>Our Lamps are gone out.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. In the Third place, you may conſider this now, that they would light their <hi>Lamps</hi> again: They would furniſh themſelves with Oil from thoſe that they have joined with in the World, while they were here in the World; They ſaid unto the <hi>Wiſe, Give us of your Oil, for our Lamps are gone out.</hi> There is an Endeavour to pin themſelves (as it were) upon the Saints and Servants of God, with whom they held a Converſe and Correſpondence here: They ſay, <hi>Give us of your Oil;</hi> Shall we be no better, That you have prayed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt with us; and that you have heard the Word of God with us, and that we were joined with you; ſhall this do us no good? <hi>Give us of your Oil.</hi> But you ſee,</p>
                     <p>4. In the Fourth Place, There is no manner of Relief that way; no good at all will be done us, if we have not the power of Faith and Repentance in our ſelves; If we have not real converſe, and Communion with, and Union to Jeſus Chriſt, it will do us no good at that Day, that we have had our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and Worſhip, that we have had our Communion with the Servants of God.</p>
                     <p>It is ſaid (<hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 11.) <hi>That many ſhall come from the Eaſt and Weſt, and ſhall ſit down with Abraham, and Iſaac, and Jacob, in the Kingdom of Heaven, but the Children of the Kingdom</hi> (there's the great Emphaſis of the thing) <hi>ſhall be caſt out into outer dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth:</hi> Though they were the <hi>Children</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and though they had a Right
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41902:63"/> 
                        <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> in regard of the Glorying they had made of being their <hi>Children:</hi> So that it is not our Converſe and Communion with Saints, or our being of a Church; it will do no Man any good to be the Son or Daughter of ſuch a Church, (as ſome Men love to ſpeak) or to be a Member of ſuch a Church, as others ſpeak: I ſay, theſe things will do us no good, if we have not the Power and Life of Grace in our hearts, <hi>Let every Man prove his own Work</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>and then he ſhall have rejoicing in himſelf, and not in another.</hi> And ſo in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, we may further underſtand the Circumſtances, in which the <hi>fooliſh Virgins ariſe:</hi> They cannot have the leaſt advantage, or the leaſt good, by all the Saints that they have known, and have kept company with, or heard, or Received the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with: Nay, though they had <hi>Eat and Drunk in Chriſt's Preſence;</hi> and if they had heard Chriſt himſelf, it would have done them no good, without the Power wherewith Chriſt taught them in. I ſpeak not this, that we ſhould ſlight the Society of Saints, but that we ſhould love them entirely, and our <hi>delight</hi> ſhould be in them, as in the <hi>Excellent of the Earth.</hi> But ſtill, we muſt have the <hi>ſame ſpirit of Faith</hi> with them, or elſe it will do us no good: <hi>No,</hi> ſay they, <hi>not ſo, leſt we have not enough for our ſelves and you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which ſhews indeed, the Vanity and Folly of <hi>Popery,</hi> in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying Men upon the hopes of other Men; the Merits of ſuch a Saint, and ſuch a Saint: It is a thing ſo ſilly, and ſo fooliſh and beggarly in Religion, that I don't think it worth the ſpeaking of; but there have been times, when ſuch Foppery and Foolery hath taken place upon Multitudes of this Nation; but bleſſed be God it is not ſo now: Though there be multitudes of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that would have gone upon the Faith and Holineſs, and the Charity, even by way of Judgment and Opinion, of ſuch a Saint heretofore: But I think it not worth the ſpending much time on the Opinion, but on the miſtake of Profeſſors now. I go on to the next Particular: And that is, <hi>They went to buy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What is the meaning of this but only this; their vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, if it were poſſible for them to mend their Faith, to mend their Repentance at that time: It is a ſhadow of this, O that it were poſſible now, That inſtead of the falſe Faith I have, I might have a true Faith; I would have a true Repentance upon any Terms whatſoever. O the Cry that <hi>Fooliſh Virgins</hi> will make,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41902:64"/> when they have had Opportunity, and loſt their Opportunity! <hi>While they went to buy, the Bridegroom came; and they that were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, went in with him to the Wedding: They</hi> that were <hi>ready,</hi> that had true Faith and Repentance, juſt at the time that the others went to buy: <hi>And the Door was ſhut, and they came and ſaid, Lord, Lord, Open to us; But he anſwered and ſaid, Verily I ſay unto you, I know you not.</hi> Wherein</p>
                     <p>Firſt of all, We may obſerve, as I ſaid, They would have it at any rate, if it were poſſible to be had, the Truth of Faith, and the Truth of Repentance, and the Truth of Holineſs, and of the Spirit of God dwelling in them; But while they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to amend, and to repair what they had ſo miſerably been miſtaken in while they were here; They find, There's no Amendment in that State, They find, that there is no going over the thing again. <hi>Work</hi> therefore (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>while it is day; for the Night cometh when no Man can work.</hi> And therefore, let us look to it, while we are here in the World.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall therefore cloſe the Diſcourſe, in the brief Application of it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the Firſt Place, it teaches us very ſeriouſly to conſider, and ſo far as any of us have Opportunity, to Propogate the koowledge of this thing, among all the Prophane and Wicked of the World; ſo far as (I ſay) they will bear it; or that we can have place to ſpeak ſo much to them; To conſider, if <hi>fooliſh Virgins</hi> will not be accepted in that Day; O! What will be the End of thoſe that are ſo boldly and inſolently prophane and wicked?</p>
                     <p>It were a happy thing indeed, in regard of the preſent ſtate of things, and of the hopes of ſomething better; That we could prevail upon Perſons that we know, are prodigiouſly Contemners of God, and bold in Sin, and Railers at, and Scoffers of every thing that is good, and that wallow like Swine in the Mire, and that are drinking up the Vomit of their Sins perpetually, and doing the ſame things over and over again. O that Perſons would be prevailed with to read the Firſt of the <hi>Proverbs!</hi> And to draw the Land-ſcaph of their Caſe, by looking upon <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> and reading his Story: I ſay, That they would be prevailed with: Men that are Carouſing and ſhewing their Contempt of God, and of every thing ſacred, Oh that they might be prevailed with. For (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>If the righteous be ſcarcely ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:41902:64"/> and <hi>fooliſh Virgins</hi> periſh, <hi>where ſhall the Wicked and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear?</hi> And</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In the Second Place; Then let every one of us, as I hope, upon the generality, there may be drawn this Title of <hi>a Virgin,</hi> without any injury done to Chriſt; I hope, we do make a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of God and Chriſt, ſeriouſly; We do Pray and Hear, and wait upon God in his Word, and read the Scripture, and we are ſerious in drawing nigh to Chriſt at his Table; I ſay, I hope the Title of the <hi>Virgin</hi> may be put upon many of us, in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards.</p>
                     <p>But, Let it not be grievous to any of us (either Hearer or Speakers) to conſider this, That there are <hi>Fooliſh Virgins,</hi> as well as <hi>Wiſe:</hi> You may have a very deſirable and commendable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſtianity upon you: We may have this, and yet be <hi>fooliſh Virgins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Conſider ſeriouſly, If there be folly in our Virginity, it will utterly ſpoil it, it will be ſuch a <hi>Dead Fly</hi> in the Ointment of <hi>Virginity,</hi> that it will certainly ſpoil and poiſon all: As our Lord ſpeaks, <hi>If the Salt have loſt its ſavour:</hi> The Word in the <hi>Greek</hi> is, if it be <hi>fooliſh Salt,</hi> it goes to the <hi>Dunghil:</hi> There may be <hi>Virginity,</hi> but if it be <hi>fooliſh Virginity,</hi> it will come to be ſaid, <hi>Our Lamps are gone out:</hi> We have heard and profeſt Chriſtianity with you, but lo! now <hi>Our Lamps are gone out!</hi> We cannot hold out; Immediately the Fire of that <hi>Day</hi> (as we ſay, the Sun will put out thoſe little Fires) So the Fire of that Day, the Glory of that Day, will put out our <hi>Lamps.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this is that Point, That I ſhall eſpecially Diſcourſe to you, next, To ſhew you, <hi>Wherein is the difference between a Lamp that goes out, and a Lamp that is furniſhed with the Treaſure of Oil ſtill within it ſelf;</hi> That hath ſtill new ſupply, that hath a Fountain to ſupply it; That doth not go out, upon the very ſpot, as we ſay: And, if the Lord enable me to clear ſo great a Point, (to the Conviction of every one, that both hears and ſpeaks) How great might the advantage be? For, I would not diſcourage any from his Profeſſion; God forbid, that any one ſhould be ſtopp'd or hinder'd in the way of Chriſtianity, ſo far as they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; but yet you ſee, this is a neceſſary faithfulneſs, to be told of our danger, and perſwaded and convinced of it, if by any means we might eſcape out of the Snare, that the <hi>Snare might be broken,</hi> and <hi>we eſcape.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:41902:65"/>
                     <p>The Third Application I make is this:</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That according to the aſſurance I have given you, and that I profeſs in the Preſence of God, with greateſt ſincerity, upon dueſt Conſideration, to be more and more aſſured, <hi>That the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Jeſus Chriſt draws very near, and very hard, and very faſt upon us;</hi> That therefore you would have another Conſideration of theſe things, than thoſe that lived a great way of of the Time. For, though it is true, if any of us come to die, it will be the ſame caſe, as if the Day of Judgment were juſt now upon him; but yet ſtill, the Scripture makes uſe of this, as a further and higher Argument, <hi>It is high time now to awake, the Night paſſeth, the Day is at hand, your Salvation is nearer;</hi> And therefore, I beſeech you, That you would ſeriouſly take it into Conſideration, and to Heart, That the <hi>ends of the World</hi> muſt needs be <hi>upon us;</hi> For, if the Apoſtle ſaid, that the <hi>Ends of the World came upon them,</hi> ſo many Hundred Years ſince, how can it be, but that the <hi>Ends of the World</hi> muſt be <hi>upon us?</hi> We are on the very laſt Sands of the Glaſs of the World: And therefore, Let this <hi>Preaching of John the Baptiſt,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> be in all your Ears and Hearts, <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand:</hi> Look to be <hi>wiſe Virgins,</hi> for the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> will not long <hi>delay his coming:</hi> He hath delay'd it ſo long, but will not delay it long now: And then,</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In the laſt Place, I beſeech you, be not ſo afraid of the Coming of the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt:</hi> This will be your great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; If any would chooſe, they would chooſe to ſee the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt in its ſucceſſion:</hi> For, I have always taken care to diſtinguiſh to you theſe two.</p>
                     <p>There is a great Difference betwixt the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in its <hi>Glory,</hi> as it ſhall be at the Time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deſigned by this Text and Parable; and another thing intended by its <hi>Succeſſion, Rev.</hi> 11. 15. As a King Entring upon his Reign; which you know, is immediately, and as ſoon as the former King went off, and (as they ſpeak) Demiſed, It is another thing, his Inauguration: You know there is a diſtance of Time, between the Entring in of the Reign, and Succeſſion; and the Coronation, the great Time of Glory: And ſo there's a difference betwixt Chriſt's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when the <hi>Midnight-Cry</hi> ſhall be, and his coming into the <hi>Succeſſion</hi> of his <hi>Kingdom:</hi> For, there ſhall be a wonderful pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Spirit of God, as ſoon as ever the <hi>Kingdom of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41902:65"/> Chriſt</hi> ſhall come into <hi>its Succeſſion:</hi> There ſhall be a mighty <hi>Preaching of the Everlaſting Goſpel;</hi> Chriſtianity ſhall grow much higher, much more pure, much more efficacious; there ſhall be bringing in multitudes of <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that are now Unbelievers in Chriſt, <hi>Mahometan</hi> or <hi>Pagan; Antichriſtians,</hi> and the Ancient <hi>Iſrael</hi> coming in, as I have often ſaid: Who then can be perſwaded, that it ſhall be poſſible to ſee the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> flocking in to Chriſt, and that there ſhould be any, that ſhould not believe in Chriſt, and receive his Goſpel? And therefore, I ſay, know aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly, That it will be a great advantage to you.</p>
                     <p>And, for my part, There's nothing that I more earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, or have a greater value for, than to ſee the Dawns of the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt;</hi> Oh! That God would give any of us leave to ſee this, We ſhould have great advantage of making our <hi>Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Election ſure,</hi> of <hi>working out our ſalvation with fear and trembling,</hi> of being perſwaded of the things that <hi>pertain to the Kingdom of God;</hi> we ſhould have great opportunities every way; And therefore, as Chriſt ſpeaks, when he propounded the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them, <hi>Matth. 13. 17. I ſay unto you, That many Prophets and Righteous Men have deſired to ſee thoſe things which ye ſee, and have not ſeen them, and to hear thoſe things which ye hear, and have not heard them:</hi> So if God ſhall continue any of our lives, but a few years, to ſee the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> appearing in this Firſt Glory; O happy and bleſſed ſhall we be! For, from the very beginning and foundation of the World to this day, <hi>Many Prophets and Righteous Men have deſired to ſee thoſe things</hi> which we ſhall ſee then, and have not ſeen them; and to hear thoſe things that we ſhall hear, and have not heard them.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, Let none of us be diſcouraged, if God call us ſooner out of the World; For, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>All thoſe that are Chriſt's,</hi> he will certainly <hi>bring with him:</hi> And, it will certainly be a happier and ſecurer ſtate, to be <hi>ſleeping in Jeſus,</hi> and <hi>dying in Jeſus;</hi> For though we do not ſee theſe things here, our Spirits ſhall ſee them above; and our Bodies ſhall be raiſed in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for us to come with Chriſt in: And as to thoſe who are not as they deſire to be, for my part, I know not any thing can be ſpoken for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Tydings, or any thing that ſhould more earneſtly engage our Faith, and Prayer, than to have that great opportunity, to wind up our Faith and Love, and Repentance, to their own height; even that of the Coming of the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> into its
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41902:66"/> 
                        <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> and to ſee thoſe bleſſed things, and to hear them, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny excellent perſons have deſired to ſee, and hear, and have not: And therefore, let none be offended, that the Kingdom of Chriſt is near at hand; for, we ſhall have greater, and more bleſſed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages and opportunities, to make <hi>our Calling and Election ſure,</hi> when that time comes.</p>
                     <p>Let us therefore deſire, to hear thoſe loud Voices from Heaven Proclaim, <hi>That the Kingdoms of this World, are become the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt:</hi> On which will ſoon follow that pouring out of the Spirit, and the <hi>Preaching the Everlaſting Goſpel.</hi>

                     <p>I Have led you through ſeveral parts of this great and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Parable: The laſt thing I Diſcourſed to you, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Midnight-Cry,</hi> and endeavoured to ſhew you:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That though there might be ſome uſe made of it, as a Deſcription of any Judgment, that ſhould come upon the Churches of Chriſt, before his Coming; Yet, That the Principal Intention is, That Cry, That Voice of the Son of God, That Shout that the Lord will deſcend in, That Voice of the Archangel, That Trump of God, that ſhall raiſe all that are aſleep in their Graves, and ſhall bring them forth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I Endeavoured to open to you, <hi>That every one ſhall riſe in the very ſame Circumſtances wherein they lay down in Death, and in the Grave.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore, That the Day of Judgment coming upon Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and Inſolent Perſons, upon the <hi>Fools that ſay in their hearts, There is no God,</hi> will be like the <hi>Writing of the Fingers on the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41902:66"/> Wall before Belſhazzar,</hi> that we read of <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. And as it comes upon ignorant Perſons in Chriſtianity, and upon the Worldlings, thoſe <hi>Fools</hi> that ſay, <hi>We have much Goods laid up for many Years;</hi> and therefore, <hi>Soul, Take thy eaſe, Eat, Drink and be Merry.</hi> O! what an Earthquake will it be upon them, to ſee the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt!</hi> Now, They ſhall be raiſed, both the <hi>Fools</hi> that ſay, <hi>That there is no God,</hi> and the Worldlings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They ſhall be raiſed juſt in the ſame Terror, in the ſame Conſternation, as if the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake was now upon them, or in the Time of Life, now on Earth.</p>
                     <p>But I propoſed to ſhew you alſo, <hi>Wherein the ſtate of the</hi> fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, <hi>and the</hi> wiſe Virgins <hi>differ;</hi> wherein this great difference lies, <hi>That one enter into the Wedding, and the other are ſhut out.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And that is it, which now, by the aſſiſtance of God, I would undertake, and go forward, to give you a clear Repreſentation of this great Matter: For (as I told you) <hi>Virgins,</hi> beſpeaks a being of the Pure and True Religion; the true Religion of the Goſpel, the Doctrine of God in the Goſpel: For all, whatſoever falſe Doctrine, or falſe Worſhip does adulterate this, it is called in Scripture, not by the Name of <hi>Virginity,</hi> but by the Name of <hi>Whoredom,</hi> by the Name of Adultery and Fornication.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whatever defiles the Religion of Jeſus Chriſt, is not ſtiled <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity,</hi> but by other Names; And therefore it is certain, That theſe <hi>Virgins</hi> muſt be of the trueſt and of the pureſt Religion of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond Place I told you, <hi>That they muſt needs be of a tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, ſober Converſation:</hi> They are not of the Prophane, the Drunkards or the Swearers, or the Senſualiſts of the World; but they are thoſe, that walk in ſuch unblameable life, that they are worthy to be counted, and to be ſtiled <hi>Virgins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What a critical Caſe therefore, What a very nice and curious Point is this, that diſtinguiſhes between the <hi>wiſe</hi> and the <hi>fooliſh Virgins?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If therefore God ſhall be pleaſed, in any meaſure, to enable me to open this to you, and that you may aright conceive, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand ſo great a Point; I hope, That by his Bleſſing, our <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together may be for the</hi> better, <hi>and not for the</hi> worſe.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall therefore apply my ſelf to it,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, By conſidering the ſcope of the <hi>Parable</hi> in this Matter: And, I find, That it lies here:</p>

                     <p>The one had <hi>Oyl</hi> in their <hi>Lamps,</hi> but they had not <hi>Oyl</hi> in their <hi>Veſſels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The other had <hi>Oyl</hi> in their <hi>Veſſels</hi> as well as in their <hi>Lamps.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So, that it comes to this; One hath a Treaſure, a Store of Grace, beyond the Profeſſion, the other hath not.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall Anſwer very plainly, and down-right Diſcourſe in this thing; by leading you to ſome great Expreſſions of Scripture, which do to me aſſure, what our Lord intends. In the Third <hi>Chapter</hi> of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians, v. 16, &amp;c.</hi> The Apoſtle, in that Great and Excellent Prayer, begs of the <hi>Father of Glory;</hi> the <hi>Father of Glory!</hi> An Expreſſion moſt ſuitable and agreeable to the Kingdom of Chriſt, appearing in its Glory, to which this <hi>Parable</hi> refers: <hi>That he would grant you, according to the riches of his Glory, to be ſtrengthned with might, by his Spirit in the inner man: That Chriſt may dwell in your hearts by Faith:</hi> I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this to be <hi>Oyl in the Veſſel.</hi> It is Chriſt abiding in the heart: For tho indeed the <hi>Veſſel</hi> is not the <hi>Fountain;</hi> yet it ſpeaks the <hi>Veſſel</hi> cloſely conjoyned with the <hi>Fountain;</hi> and the <hi>Fountain</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſpringing into't.</p>
                     <p>Another place of Scripture that I would give you: You know <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> they are much required and inſiſted on in the Goſpel, now obſerve what the Apoſtle ſaith, in the 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 14. And the Grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant, with Faith and Love which is in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> Where is the Treaſure of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love?</hi> It is in Chriſt Jeſus, it is never out of him; the Spring of it is never out of him; <hi>Faith and Love which is in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> The <hi>Spring</hi> overflows to the <hi>Veſſel,</hi> with <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> but the <hi>Spring</hi> and the <hi>Fountain</hi> is Chriſt himſelf.</p>
                     <p>And ſo, 2 <hi>Tim. 2, 1. Thou therefore, my Son, be ſtrong in the Grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus: Be ſtrong in the Grace that is in him.</hi> It is never out of him, though it flows to the Souls and Spirits of Believers, yet it is never out of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>So that here is the <hi>Oyl</hi> in the Treaſure of it; it is when the Soul is united to Chriſt, the Fountain of it; here is the <hi>Oyl</hi> that is able to bear up.</p>
                     <p>For, in two things, I think, the compariſon lies, that our Lord intended in this Parable, between <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Oyl.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, It muſt needs be of ſuch an excellent quality, that it can bear up with the Glory of that Day; And then,</p>
                     <p>In the Second place, It muſt be ſo abundant, that it can laſt with the Glory of that Day.</p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:41902:67"/>
                     <p>For, if the <hi>Oyl</hi> be not of the high and excellent kind, it will preſently go out.</p>
                     <p>As you know, the higher Light of the Sun, it puts out the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Light of Fire or Tapers, that we have below; ſo the Glory of that Day will put out any Light, but only the Light of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Grace that is in Jeſus Chriſt, and none elſe will laſt; There's no Spring of Light, but only that which comes from him, <hi>Heb. 7. 16. who is after the power of an endleſs life.</hi> It is only Chriſt that is Oil in the Treaſure; Therefore, take the moſt Excellent Grace; That's the Point that I would endeavour to carry out to you: Take the moſt Excellent Grace; if it be out of Chriſt, if it be only in the Perſon himſelf, it is a <hi>Lamp</hi> that will go out; but if the <hi>Veſſel</hi> be at the <hi>Fountain Head,</hi> and is joined to the <hi>Fountain;</hi> then it is able to ſupply to the Glory of that Day.</p>
                     <p>And I ſhall repreſent it to you therefore, by a Hiſtory of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that may ſerve as an excellent Parallel, to Expound the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that I am now upon; In 2 <hi>Kings 4. 1. There cried a certain Woman of the Wives of the Sons of the Prophets unto Eliſha, ſaying, Thy Servant my Husband is dead, and thou knoweſt that thy Servant did fear the Lord; and the Creditor is come to take unto him my two Sons to be Bond-men. And Eliſha ſaid unto her, What ſhall I do for thee? Tell me, What haſt thou in the Houſe? And ſhe ſaid, Thine Hand-Maid hath not any thing in the Houſe, ſave a Pot of Oil. Then he ſaid, Go, Borrow thee Veſſels abroad of all thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, even empty Veſſels, borrow not a few. And when thou art come in, thou ſhalt ſhut<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Door upon thee, and upon thy Sons, and ſhall pour out into all thoſe Veſſels, and thou ſhalt ſet aſide that which is full. So ſhe went from him, and ſhut the Door upon her, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her Sons, who brought the Veſſels to her, and ſhe poured out. And it came to paſs, when the Veſſels were full, that ſhe ſaid unto her Son, bring me yet a Veſſel. And he ſaid unto her, There is not a Veſſel more. And the Oil ſtayed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now this is the thing only, That I would repreſent to you; That to us, that are in a miſerable and needy, and wanting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and in danger to be Bond-Men and Bond-Women to the Wrath and Juſtice of God for ever, Here is the <hi>Oil multiplied;</hi> The <hi>Oil</hi> multiplies from the Fountain, from the Infinite Grace that is in Jeſus Chriſt, that we may ſtand at that Day.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, That which I would adviſe, and preſs upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of us, from this very Point is, <hi>That above all things we
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41902:68"/> would mind our being in Chriſt.</hi> I ſhall endeavour to free it from all Objections that you may be ready to make, before I cloſe the Point.</p>
                     <p>But, to give you a Parable, or a Repreſentation that is nearer, and does indeed intend this very thing; If you look into the Prophet <hi>Zachary,</hi> you ſhall ſee what it is to have <hi>Oil,</hi> not only in the <hi>Lamp,</hi> but in the <hi>Veſſel;</hi> that is, to have a continual ſupply.</p>
                     <p>For, though indeed, this Parable ſeems to go no further, than <hi>Oil</hi> in the <hi>Veſſel;</hi> yet when we come to enter into it, we muſt needs find, that it muſt be <hi>Oil</hi> from the Fountain alone, that can do us good, <hi>Zach. 4. 1, 2. And the Angel that talked with me, came again, and waked me, as a Man that is wakened out of his ſleep; And ſaid unto me, what Seeſt thou? and I ſaid, I looked, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, a Candleſtick all of Gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his Seven Lamps thereon, and Seven Pipes to the Seven Lamps, which were upon the top thereof: And two Olive-Trees by it, one upon the Right ſide of the Bowl,</hi> and <hi>the other upon the Left ſide thereof.</hi> And it came to that; <hi>The Sons of oyl</hi> (as they are called, <hi>v.</hi> 12.) through the <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Pipes empty the Golden Oil out of themſelves into the Golden Bowl.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, What's the Meaning of all this? <hi>Not by Might, nor by Power,</hi> but <hi>by my Spirit, ſaith the Lord;</hi> that's the Meaning of all: They <hi>Empty the Golden Oil out of themſelves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That <hi>Golden Oil,</hi> by which our <hi>Lamps</hi> will bear up and ſhine at that Day, it muſt come from thoſe <hi>Sons of Oyl;</hi> That is, From thoſe <hi>Olive-branches,</hi> Both which are only a Repreſentation of Chriſt's <hi>Fulneſs</hi> in his Righteouſneſs, and in his Spirit.</p>
                     <p>So that here is that, that alone can bear us up, and bear up the Shining of our <hi>Lamps</hi> in that Day of the Glorious Solemnity of the <hi>Marriage of the Lamb:</hi> That which alone can bear us up, is the Righteouſneſs and Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt; Which are always Connected and Joyned one with another.</p>
                     <p>And, Proportionable hereunto are other Similitudes; The <hi>Wedding-Garment,</hi> that we read of, <hi>Matt.</hi> 22. which, a Man not having on, when he came to the Wedding, <hi>he was ſound Speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs;</hi> That is Nothing, but the Garment of the Righteouſneſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and of the Graces of his Spirit. <hi>The King came in to ſee the Gueſts, he ſaw there a Man which had not on a Wedding-Garment;</hi> (The ſame with <hi>Oyl in the Veſſel:) And he ſaith unto him, Friend, How cameſt thou in hither, not having a Wedding Garment? And he was Speechleſs; Bind him Hand and Foot, and take him away,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>and cast him into outer Darkneſs,</hi> becauſe he had not the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41902:68"/> 
                        <hi>Linen White and Clean,</hi> the Righteouſneſs of Saints, <hi>Robes waſh'd in the Blood of the Lamb;</hi> for that's the <hi>Wedding-Garment.</hi> He had not put on the <hi>Wedding-Garment of Chriſt;</hi> he had not on <hi>the White Raiment. Buy of me Gold tryed in the Fire,</hi> and White Raiment (ſuitable to that Time) and <hi>buy of me Eye-Salve, that thou may'st ſee, &amp;c. Rev.</hi> 3. All is from Chriſt. So that the Whole Matter is This; Whether we are in Chriſt, or whether we are not in Chriſt?</p>
                     <p>So the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaith, 1 John 5. 12. <hi>He that hath the Son,</hi> (here's the plain Propoſition, the Caſe of every Man) <hi>He that hath the Son, hath Life; And he that hath not the Son of God, hath not Life: And this is ihe Record, that God hath given to us Eternal Life,</hi> (the Place is as full to the Purpoſe, as poſſibly can be) God hath given to us Eternal Life, <hi>and this Life is in his Son,</hi> in the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. <hi>The Sun of Righteouſneſs ariſes with healing in his Wings. He that hath the Son, hath Life, and he that hath not the Son of God, hath not Life:</hi> And hereby, we may underſtand that great Place of Scripture, which elſe may be more hard to be underſtood, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 28. ſaith the Apoſtle there, out of the <hi>Prophet Iſaiah. A ſhort work</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>will the Lord make upon the Earth:</hi> What is the meaning of that, <hi>That he will make ſuch a ſhort Work upon the Earth?</hi> The Meaning is this, That it ſhall come to this ſpeedy Queſtion: Are you in Chriſt? Or are you not in Chriſt? <hi>For he will finiſh the Work, and cut it ſhort in Righteouſneſs; becauſe a ſhort Work will the Lord make upon the Earth. A ſhort Work.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Many are ready to think, That the Judiciary part of the Day of Judgment will be a mighty long time; Becauſe every Caſe of a Man muſt be examined, and his Works; It is a Miſtake, when we think ſo.</p>
                     <p>For though it will be, as exact to every Man, as if every Man's Caſe were laid down in his particular Works, <hi>viz.</hi> of thoſe who are not pardoned; But yet it will be a time of the <hi>blotting out of Iniquity;</hi> I ſay, a Time of the full <hi>blotting out of Sin,</hi> in all the Servants of God; Though Sins are ſought for, they ſhall not be found, There ſhall be none, but upon the Wicked.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A ſhort Work will the Lord make</hi> upon the Wicked, when they are found not to be in Chriſt; They have not a biding Light; They are preſently found by the Company they are in, and by the Habit of the Body; For the Saints are in the Habit of Bodies of Glory; And the other, in the Habit of Bodies of Contempt:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41902:69"/> So, a <hi>ſhort Work will the Lord make:</hi> It will be preſently ſeen by our Appearance, whether we are Chriſt's, or no.</p>
                     <p>Now this I ſhall endeavour to Argue to you a little from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Reaſon, And then it ſhall be the Principal Part of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe to clear to you the Doubts and Scruples, and Objections, that may ariſe in your Minds; That this cannot be ſo.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, In regard of other Scriptures, that inſiſt ſo much upon what is in us; And then to Anſwer theſe Queſtions.</p>
                     <p>In the Second Place, you may ſay,</p>
                     <p>How ſhall we come to have an Intereſt in Chriſt? And</p>
                     <p>In the Third Place; How ſhall we know, That we have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt?</p>
                     <p>And ſo I ſhall conclude with the Application of All.</p>
                     <p>The Great Scripture-Argument I would give you, is this:</p>
                     <p>If we could ſeriouſly conſider the Infinite Holineſs, and Purity of God; If we could but (I ſay) ſeriouſly lay this to Heart; That God cannot ſee Things, any other ways than they are, How would it clear this? A great many Good Men are ready to ſay,</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Evangelical Righteouſneſs</hi> that we have, ſhall ſtand before God, in Juſtification; for Chriſt's ſake.</p>
                     <p>I ſay, If we ſeriouſly conſider, That God is Infinitely Holy; That <hi>the Angels he charges with Folly; That the Heavens are not clean in his Sight;</hi> That he cannot ſee any otherwiſe, than Things are: I do beſeech you to conſider, Whether you would venture into the Preſence of ſuch a Holineſs, with the Beſt Graces, that you know in any Perſon in the World? For my part, I do not know how Men can Anſwer it in their own Judgments: But I think, it is as impoſſible for any Man to appear with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of the beſt Saint, that ever was in the World, (except the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt) as I think it impoſſible for a Man to ſtand in the Greateſt Preſence, without Confuſion, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Squallidneſs, and Filthineſs of Impure Garments, and Putrefaction all over him. For, ſurely, the Saints of God ſpeak in the Name of all Saints; <hi>All our Righteouſneſſes are as filthy Rags;</hi> and <hi>our Iniquities, like the Wind, hurry us away:</hi> And there's no ſtanding, but by that ſtable Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Jehovah</hi> our Righteouſneſs, and by the Holineſs that flows from his Death, and from his Reſurrection, and that is under the Cover of his Blood, and under the Anſwer, that his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs makes for the Imperfection of it.</p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:41902:69"/>
                     <p>I am ſure, this Reaſon is ſo ſolid, ſo ſubſtantial, and ſo weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; That whoever Conſiders it, muſt needs yield, and ſubmit to it, if they do not go off from it, but ſtrictly and preciſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it; That no other Righteouſneſs can be accepted, but only the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and the Holineſs that flows from it, that needs the Cover of his Righteouſneſs, and is made up in its own Imperfection, by the Perfection of his Righteouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>Surely, it muſt be a great Hazard, for ſuch a Perſon as <hi>Paul,</hi> to go before the Judgment-Seat, with his own Righteouſneſs, when he ſaid, (even in a State of Grace, and in Jeſus Chriſt) 1 Cor. 4. 4. <hi>I know nothing by my ſelf, yet am I not hereby juſtified;</hi> For he <hi>that judgeth me, is the Lord:</hi> If we have not now the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, How then can we ſtand before God!</p>
                     <p>I Argue this, not ſo much, to make you of an Opinion, or a Judgment; (for that I ought not to aim at) but with the utmoſt Sincerity, as God inables me, that you may know, your Peace, and Safety, and Security lies only in the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>That <hi>Lamp</hi> will certainly be <hi>put out</hi> in <hi>obſcure Darkneſs,</hi> that hath not the Golden Oil: And therefore I ſpeak, that you may have your Hearts full of this; Chriſt, and Chriſt only. I am ſo far from being moved by any Objection, that I am aſſured, That this is the True Grace of God that I now Preach to you, wherein we are all to ſtand: We read, <hi>Heb. 24. Chriſt is not entered into the Holy Places made with Hands, which are Figures of the true,</hi> but <hi>into Heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the Preſence of God for us:</hi> We Tranſlate it, <hi>In the Preſence of God;</hi> but the <hi>Greek</hi> is much more Emphatical: He Appears, or is made apparent to the <hi>Face of God</hi> for us: Now, Chriſt is preſent with, and makes himſelf appear to the very <hi>Face of God;</hi> That <hi>Face,</hi> that is Ten Thouſand times Brighter than the Sun, and that Dazles all Created Righteouſneſs; Chriſt appears to that very <hi>Face,</hi> and he appears now, in his own Blood, to that very Face, for us. Herein is our great Comfort, when we come before the <hi>Face</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> Chriſt appears to that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Face,</hi> in our Behalf: It is further ſaid, <hi>Nor yet that</hi> he <hi>ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himſelf</hi> often; as the High-Prieſt Offer'd other Sacrifices: <hi>For then muſt he often have Suffered, ſince the Foundation of the World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It may be, you only read this, with a General Thought of it; and may not have conſidered the deep Senſe, and the Importance of it.</p>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:41902:70"/>
                     <p>For, I ask, Why Chriſt muſt have <hi>Suffered often, from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World,</hi> if he had not been a <hi>Lamb ſlain, once for All?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Anſwer is, If his <hi>Offering</hi> had not been an <hi>Offering once for All,</hi> It muſt have ariſen from the Inſufficiency of it, the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Imperfection of it, to have done <hi>All at once;</hi> and then he muſt, (as the Apoſtle ſays) <hi>Have Suffer'd often, ſince the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World;</hi> and not have Died only 1700 Years ago, when the World was about 4000 Years old; but he muſt have <hi>Suffer'd from the very Foundation of the World:</hi> He muſt have begun there, where the Sin of Man, the Apoſtacy of <hi>Adam</hi> enter'd, and he muſt ſtill have been Suffering; For the World could not have been born up, but by the Efficacy of his Sacrifice, and therefore it muſt ſtill have been renew'd. The World hath been variouſly divided, the <hi>Old World</hi> before the <hi>Flood,</hi> and then before <hi>the Law,</hi> and ſince <hi>the Law till Chriſt;</hi> It is capable of more Diviſions; but divide it as we can, I do not ſee how any Diviſion of it could have been without the Sacrifice of Chriſt, nor how often each Diviſion would have requir'd the Benefit of it, if <hi>once Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering</hi> had not been <hi>for All;</hi> but becauſe <hi>once Offering of a Lamb without Spot,</hi> by the <hi>Eternal Spirit,</hi> doth Perfect and Conſecrate for ever to the Enjoyment of God, and Freedom from Wrath Them who are Sanctified from the Guilt and the Power of Sin; And ſo it looks backward to all ſuch before it, as a <hi>Lamb ſlain, from the Foundation of the World,</hi> and forward to all, who ſhall be to the <hi>Delivery up of the Kingdom</hi> to God <hi>All in All,</hi> and even throughout Eternity, ſupporting Saints in their Union to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his Love by <hi>Himſelf:</hi> Hence this Great <hi>High-Priest</hi> choſe his Time in <hi>the End of the World,</hi> ſhewing the Right of Chriſt, to have put an end upon this Sunk, Fallen, Defiled World; but that for Wiſeſt and Holieſt Purpoſes, <hi>Viſion</hi> and <hi>Propheſie,</hi> in the Great Efficacy of his Redemption were Seal'd, and now of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are near to be opened: This was the <hi>Fulneſs of Time,</hi> not <hi>far</hi> from the Fulneſs <hi>of Times,</hi> or of <hi>all Time;</hi> That is, from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Now on this Foundation of his Sacrifice for ever <hi>perfecting Them who are Sanctified,</hi> we learn, That as All is Deriv'd from Chriſt, <hi>Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, Redemption;</hi> So it is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in him, he hath for ever <hi>perfected,</hi> as in himſelf; For all ſtill reſts in him, and depends upon Freſh Receivings from him,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41902:70"/> as is moſt evident in this; He went immediately <hi>into the Holy Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces made without Hands,</hi> there to <hi>appear in the Preſence of God;</hi> or according to the Force of the <hi>Greek,</hi> there to be made Illuſtrious to the very <hi>Face of God for us:</hi> So that notwithſtanding what he hath done, we could not dare to appear to the <hi>Face of God,</hi> if he were not there <hi>for us,</hi> appearing to that <hi>very Face,</hi> receiving the Grace, and Favour of it, and Reflecting it on us: And ſo in San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, in the ſtricteſt, and moſt proper Senſe of it, It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually Iſſuing from his <hi>Blood;</hi> The Blood of the <hi>Everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> ſends forth the Efficacy of <hi>making perfect in every good Work, working in us,</hi> that which is <hi>well pleaſing in his Sight.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now then from hence ariſes a Neceſſity of continual <hi>Looking to Jeſus, the Author and Finiſher of our Faith,</hi> in both Juſtification and Sanctification.</p>
                     <p>Take then, as in relation to the Point of Juſtification, our Faith, our Love, our Repentance, our Charity, our Holineſs, our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and ſeparate theſe from the Satisfaction, Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, and how can they ſtand before God on any account whatever, even in the Senſe of All that do at all acknowledge Chriſt! But beyond this, How pitiful are they, compar'd with <hi>Everlaſting Righteouſneſs,</hi> with <hi>Infinite Righteouſneſs!</hi> Nay, ſo Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and ſo Polluted are they, that they cannot ſo much as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into any the leaſt Conſideration in the Point of Righteouſneſs, or Juſtification, but they muſt needs before a Righteous, and Holy God, Themſelves, and the Perſons, in whom they are, fall under Condemnation: And in point of Holineſs, if you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide them from Chriſt, They are like a Beam, or a Ray cut off from the Sun, it immediately vaniſhes, and comes to nothing; As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, The Conſcience truly enlightned, will ſay; Alas, I cannot come before God with this, and that, which looks like Godlineſs, Holineſs, or what we call Religion, as in Prayer, or other Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; I muſt have the Infinite Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, elſe I know my <hi>Lamp</hi> will immediately <hi>go out:</hi> So in point of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, even that Holineſs we receive from Chriſt, all its Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Life is in Union to Chriſt, If it be ſeparate from him, it is like a Drop out of the Fountain; A Drop in the Fountain is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, while it is in it; If you ſeparate it from it, it preſently is loſt, and comes to nothing: <hi>My Son</hi> (ſays he unto <hi>Timothy) be ſtrong in the Grace,</hi> that <hi>is in Jeſus Christ;</hi> it muſt be in him, Conſerv'd in him; Elſe, it is as a Ray wandring from the Sun,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41902:71"/> or a Drop from the Fountain, or to ſpeak in the Language of the Parable, as a <hi>Lamp</hi> from the <hi>Veſſel,</hi> or even the <hi>Veſſel</hi> from the <hi>Son of Oil:</hi> The Sum of all is, our dependance is on Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, our Union, and Communion with him; He is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, he is the Great <hi>Son of Oil;</hi> All <hi>Lamps</hi> go out, not ſo united; In <hi>Jehovah, ſhall one ſay, Have I Righteouſneſs, and Strength,</hi> ſtrength of Holineſs alſo; <hi>In him ſhall all his Seed be Juſtified and Glory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus far I have endeavoured to fix and eſtabliſh this Point to you; And from which, I hope, and am aſſur'd, I ſhall never find Reaſon to depart; That the <hi>Oil in the Veſſel,</hi> is the Heart united to Jeſus Chriſt by Faith; The <hi>Having the Son,</hi> and ſo <hi>having Life;</hi> For he is the Great <hi>Son of Oyl,</hi> the <hi>Branch made ſtrong,</hi> even the Fountain, the Root, the Spring to Eternity.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall now endeavour to anſwer, and to clear up, what may riſe, by way of Objection, in any of our Thoughts to this Truth.</p>
                     <p>Object. 1. <hi>It may be ſaid, All the Graces and Duties of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, of Holineſs, are they not ſpoken of, as received from, and done by the Power of Christ, and yet as if they were ours, and we ſtood by them before God, as in our ſelves? Is it not ſaid of ſuch a Saint, as of</hi> Enoch, <hi>That he</hi> walked with God? <hi>Of</hi> Noah, <hi>That he wis Just, and Perfect, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright in his</hi> Generations, <hi>and that</hi> he Walked with God? <hi>Of</hi> Abraham, <hi>That</hi> he Believed in God, <hi>and</hi> it was imputed to him for Righteouſneſs? <hi>Of</hi> David, <hi>and other Good Kings, That they Served God with an</hi> Upright Heart? <hi>Of</hi> Job, <hi>That he was an</hi> Upright, Perfect Man, <hi>That</hi> he Feared God, <hi>and</hi> Eſchewed Evil? <hi>Theſe Things ſeem to be ſpoken abſolutely, and as if the Perſons of whom they are ſpoken in theſe High Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, Subſiſted by themſelves; Chriſt may indeed lie at the Bottom, and be the Foundation, why all is accepted, and all is upon his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count principally, but yet under him, theſe Qualifications may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd as our Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Now to this I ſhall anſwer very plainly; That Scripture hath indeed laid this Foundation; Jeſus Chriſt; and <hi>Other no Man can lay,</hi> that acknowledges the Goſpel of Chriſt: And this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firmly ſetled, and the Conſequences of it look'd every way into, the Key of All is given into our Hands: For though Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41902:71"/> ſpeaks freely, and at large, and as may moſt ſerve in the Hand of the Spirit, as an Inſtrument to work upon the Hearts of thoſe, who are in Chriſt; As, <hi>Bleſſed are the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndefiled in the Way; Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are they that keep his Teſtimonies; Bleſſed is he that Conſidereth the Poor;</hi> And Innumerable the like Scriptures; Which look, as if we had a Righteouſneſs in our ſelves; Yet how exact, how poſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tive is it in leading us to the Spring, to the Fountain, to the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> Chriſt; and thereby giving us (as I ſaid) a Key into All! That All is, not only from him, but All is in him, (as the Sun holding all Light in it ſelf,) while it ſhines from him; The Head holding all Influences within himſelf, the Root, Fountain, All in him, while from him: <hi>Noah</hi> was <hi>Righteous,</hi> becauſe <hi>Heir of the Righteouſneſs of Faith uniting to Christ: David</hi> deſcribes, in relation to <hi>Abraham</hi> and all Saints, the <hi>Bleſſedneſs of the Man, to whom the Lord imputeth Righteouſneſs without Works;</hi> It conſiſts in Free Pardon, and not imputing Sin; <hi>Bleſſed is the Man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whoſe Iniquities are Forgiven,</hi> and <hi>whoſe Sins are covered; Bleſſed is the Man to whom the Lord imputeth not Sin:</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> hath many high Expreſſions ſhewing the Neceſſity of Holineſs; and yet he ſays, <hi>I deſire to be found in Christ, not having my own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, but that, which is by the Faith of the Son of God;</hi> as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſays, <hi>We will make mention of thy Righteouſneſs, even of thine only.</hi> Thus, notwithſtanding all the Holineſs, and Graces of Believers, the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is their Righteouſneſs alone, in the Point of Juſtification; And this Righteouſneſs never goes out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for then it would ſoon fail; But it is always Conſerved in himſelf, he is <hi>Jehovah, our Righteouſneſs:</hi> And ſo our Holineſs, the inward Holineſs of Saints dwells in him, and from him is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually communicated, even while the Gracious Frame is fixed in them; Yet the Frame is in Union to him, <hi>we are in Christ Jeſus,</hi> or in Union to him, <hi>Created to Good Works; In Christ Jeſus is the New Creature,</hi> or <hi>New Creation;</hi> We <hi>know him</hi> firſt, and then <hi>the Power of his Reſurrection;</hi> He is our <hi>Sanctification,</hi> and our very <hi>Wiſdom</hi> for Faith and Repentance; We are <hi>Married unto him,</hi> that is <hi>Riſen</hi> from the <hi>Dead,</hi> that <hi>we may bring forth Fruits unto God;</hi> So that All is not only from him, but in him: All therefore that is ſpoken of, as in us, or by us, is no other, but like the Attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſuch and ſuch Things to the Eyes, or to the Hands, and Feet. There is a Preparation of each Member to the Uſes, and Offices proper to it, but the very Active Part is proper to the Head alone
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41902:72"/> and to that Spirit dwelling in it, without which they are but Lumps of Clay; So that Graces, and Gracious Actions are attributed to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers who are the Curious <hi>Workmanſhip of God</hi> to ſuch <hi>Good Works;</hi> but it is, as they are in Chriſt, in whom their Spiritual Life always reſides, in and from whom it flows to them; So that the Oyl in the <hi>Veſſel</hi> ſhining through the <hi>Lamp</hi> is ſtill in Union to him, the Great <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> or Annointed of God.</p>
                     <p>Object. 2. <hi>A Second Objection, may be taken from that, in this</hi> Matth. 25, 34. <hi>You know, it is there ſaid, When Christ had ſet the Goats on the Left Hand, and the Sheep on the Right; He ſpeaks in this manner;</hi> Then ſhall the King ſay unto them Come ye Bleſſed of my Father, Inherit the Kingdom prepared for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>u: For I was an hungry, and ye gave me Meat; I was Thirſty, and ye gave me Drink; A Stranger, <hi>and</hi> ye took me in; Naked, <hi>and</hi> ye cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me; Sick and in Priſon, <hi>and</hi> ye Viſited me: <hi>And ſo on the other ſide, he ſaid to the Wicked, Ye did not ſo and ſo; And ye did nothing to my Succour and Relief: Is it not plain therefore, may Men ſay, That it is not according to the Righteouſneſs of Christ, or a Being in Christ, but according as we have done?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now I'll give you a clear Anſwer agreeable to what I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: It is true, Where Chriſt hath laid the Foundation, and hath opened the Spring of his Righteouſneſs, he takes any Grace he pleaſes, and Inſiſts upon it; Becauſe it is all of the Contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Frame, and whole Webb (as I may ſay) of his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; It is Weav'd out of his Righteouſneſs, and Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And therefore, he'll take what Grace ſoever he pleaſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is in the Fountain ſtill; It is all in the Sun, and in the Fountain: As if the Sun ſhould ſay, Here's ſuch or ſuch a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Light, and it ſhall do any thing proportionable to the Nature of ſuch a Beam of Light; But, conſider, ſuch a Beam is in me; But if it go out of me, it will preſently be as a Lamp gone out.</p>
                     <p>So, our Faith, our Love, or our Repentance, or our Holineſs, take them in the Fountain, and in the Spring, they are of great Moment: If you take them out, they are nothing at all: So here's the Caſe.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe the <hi>Robes</hi> of the <hi>Saints</hi> are Waſh'd all over in the <hi>Blood of Christ;</hi> And becauſe all our Graces are in him, as in the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41902:72"/> they are of great Value, not any to be taken in the ſingle Grace, by it ſelf, (though Chriſt is pleaſed to inſtance in this, or that, as he ſees meet) but whether one or more are ſpoken of, they are all ſpoken of, as they are in the whole Orb, and the whole Body and Sphere of Light, his own Righteouſneſs and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; And they all are Communicated from him: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, that theſe Graces are ſpoken ſo Graciouſly of, becauſe they are in him.</p>
                     <p>In the Third Place, you may ſay, <hi>But ſuppoſe I am ſatisfied and convinced, That it is not what is in my Self, but what is in Christ, where all my Imperfections are made up, and where every thing is in Purity and Perfection; This is the Great Thing lies upon me, That I don't know how to come to Christ, that I may be</hi> his, <hi>and that he may be</hi> mine.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, this is that I ſhall Anſwer to you; There are under the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity two Sorts of Men.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Thoſe that never care for theſe Things, that never mind them, that never conſider them, that never ask the Queſtion, Whether Chriſt is theirs, or not? Nor have any Thought, or any Trouble about it: Now, to ſuch Perſons, there's no great need of anſwering; It is a vain Thing to Reſolve Caſes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to an Atheiſt, to him that ſaith, <hi>There's no God, There's no Religion:</hi> So it is in vain to anſwer ſuch Scruples to the Man that never minds Chriſt, or conſiders himſelf, Whether in Chriſt, or not?</p>
                     <p>But, if there are any of us, that are really under the Senſe of the Want of Chriſt, and of the Greatneſs of that Want, If there be any ſuch; Why then there is not at any time ſuch a Thought in our Hearts as this, Whether we are Chriſt's, or not, but it is a Hopeful Argument, That Jeſus Chriſt doth Call us, and does Invite us: He doth Call and Invite us, or elſe, Why ſhould it ſo be, That we are concerned and troubled about our having, or not having of him? Our Caſe is juſt like the Caſe of that <hi>Blind Man</hi> in the Goſpel, that we read of, Mark 10. 46. <hi>When they were come to</hi> Jericho, <hi>there was a great Number of People:</hi> And <hi>Blind</hi> Bartimeus, <hi>the Son of</hi> Timeus, <hi>ſate by the Way-ſide, Begging: And when he heard that it was</hi> Jeſus <hi>of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>he began to cry out and ſay,</hi> Jeſus, <hi>thou Son of</hi> David, <hi>have Mercy on me: And
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41902:73"/> many charged him that he ſhould hold his Peace:</hi> They would not have him make ſuch ado after Chriſt; But <hi>he cry'd the more a great deal, Thou Son of</hi> David, <hi>have Mercy on me. And</hi> Jeſus <hi>ſtood ſtill, and commanded him to be called;</hi> And they call the Blind-Man, ſaying unto him, <hi>Be of good Comfort, riſe, he calleth thee.</hi> I would only make an Alluſion, and ſo an Application of this: Chriſt coming near him, Invited his Deſires, and when he Deſired, Chriſt further Invited him.</p>
                     <p>When we find our Souls moved with any thing of the Senſe of the Want of Chriſt, or Deſire after him; It is a ſign Chriſt is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near to us, and when we find that, let us cry out more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly after him, and though our own Corruptions, our own Unbelief, our own Fears, our own Luſts ſay, Don't make ſuch a ſtir after Chriſt; They charge us to hold our Peace, and <hi>Satan</hi> charges us, and many Doctrines in the World, (yea, of ſome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Men) they charge us to hold our Peace, and ſay,</p>
                     <p>Firſt of all, Get more Humiliation and Senſe of Sin; Get Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; Get Reſolutions of being better, and don't expect and ask for Salvation, till you come ſo and ſo qualified.</p>
                     <p>Now, I ſay, in this Caſe, Let us cry ſo much the more; For if we want Humiliation, where ſhould we have it, but only from Chriſt? If we want Reſolutions to Holineſs, where ſhould we have them, but from Chriſt? It is not intended, that you ſhould be negligent of Humiliation, or Senſe of Sin, or Sorrow for it, or Reſolutions for Holineſs; But the Queſtion is, Where ſhall we have theſe?</p>
                     <p>Now, I ſay, We can have them no where, but from Chriſt; From the Firſt <hi>Item</hi> of coming to God, even from firſt to laſt, to an Everlaſting Happineſs, it is from God, it is from <hi>Christ;</hi> He calleth all thoſe whoſe Souls are moved, and thoſe that have had no more Senſe of theſe things heretofore, than the very Stones and Stocks, than the very Heathen and Pagans; To all theſe, I ſay, If Chriſt do but move and ſtir you, fly ye to him, and ſay, <hi>If I pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, I'll periſh here:</hi> I know nothing in my want of Everlaſting Life, but only coming to Chriſt to help me, may every Soul ſay.</p>
                     <p>Objection. <hi>But then you'll ſay, There's a Danger, that Men ſhould Sleep, and do nothing, but put off all with coming to Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:41902:73"/>
                     <p>Don't fear this; If we are indeed in Motion to Chriſt, be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of this; He'll come to you, and make himſelf further known to you; And, in that very Moment, that you think to be doing ſomething, look upon Chriſt as the very <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Finiſher</hi> of <hi>our</hi> Faith, and in his Strength go and do it; For, ſurely, we may ſtand long enough fetching Water out of a Flint, till Jeſus Chriſt, be pleaſed to turn the <hi>Flint into a ſtanding Water:</hi> Such an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is in the <hi>Pſalms.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So I ſay, The <hi>Flint in the Heart,</hi> the Heart of <hi>Flint,</hi> Chriſt will turn into a <hi>Standing-Water;</hi> And it can never be done, till Chriſt do it.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, I know not how to adviſe ſuch otherwiſe; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny complain of the Want of this and that Grace, What Advice would you give us? Alas! Many would ſay, Be Induſtrious and Earneſt; I do not deny, but there's a Place for it, But, I ſay, It is for a Man to begin at the Wrong End of the Thing, to begin there without looking firſt to Chriſt: Let us therefore go to Chriſt; For Faith and Love are in him abundant; And he'll draw Souls to himſelf; When <hi>I am lifted up</hi> (ſaith he) I will <hi>Draw all Men to me;</hi> The Death of Chriſt upon the Croſs was a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Emblem of this <hi>Drawing:</hi> And the <hi>Father Draws,</hi> and the Spirit <hi>Convinces,</hi> That Perſons may by it be Drawn to Chriſt: It is therefore in the High and Supream Hand; And when we have any Intimations and Motives upon us, to move, and to ſtir, ſtill go to the Fountain; Go to him that <hi>is the Son of Oil:</hi> Theſe Rays and Beams lead to him that is the Spring of all Grace, from the very firſt to the laſt.</p>
                     <p>It is worthy our Conſideration, that Place of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Chap. 22. laſt Verſes, <hi>And I will faſten him as a Nail in a ſure Place, and he ſhall be for a Glorious Throne to his Father's Houſe: And they ſhall hang upon him all the Glory of his Father's Houſe, the Off-ſpring and the Iſſue;</hi> (The very Beginning and the End) Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of all Quantities; from the Veſſels of Cups, even to all the Veſſels of Flagons; They hang all upon him.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore, If you would hang your Humiliation, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, that's <hi>a Veſſel of the Off-ſpring,</hi> and it is a ſmall Veſſel, a Veſſel of ſmall Quantity; if you <hi>hang</hi> this any where, but upon <hi>the Nail in the ſure Place,</hi> nothing of Good can be expected; But if you would <hi>hang,</hi> even the leaſt <hi>Veſſel,</hi> the <hi>Veſſel</hi> of leaſt <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity</hi> any where, <hi>hang it</hi> upon Chriſt, <hi>Hang it upon the Nail in the ſure Place.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:41902:74"/>
                     <p>And, if any of you have any Troubled Thoughts, or Conteſt of Mind about theſe Things, I beſeech you, That you would go up to this <hi>Nail</hi> that is <hi>faſtned in a ſure Place;</hi> For that <hi>Veſſel,</hi> that we hang any where elſe, it ſhall certainly <hi>be cut down,</hi> and the <hi>Nail</hi> we <hi>hang</hi> it upon will certainly be <hi>cut down,</hi> or <hi>removed,</hi> for <hi>the Lord hath ſpoken it;</hi> All our <hi>Lamps</hi> that ſhine in their own Light, they will go out in that Day, at the Appearance of Chriſt, like <hi>Sparks,</hi> that we <hi>compaſs our ſelves</hi> with, of <hi>our own kindling;</hi> All that do ſo, ſhall lie down in Sorrow.</p>
                     <p>The Laſt Objection is, <hi>But, how ſhall we know that we are in Christ? Can we diſcern it any otherwiſe, than by the Marks and Signs of Grace, that we find in our Selves? If therefore we find not Faith, if we find not Repentance, and all the Fruits of Holineſs, How can we think, or dare we think that we are in Christ?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now therefore, To this I would give you this Twofold Anſwer.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, It is certain, That the Supream Witneſs to any of our Souls, it muſt be from the Spirit of Chriſt, it muſt be from the <hi>Spirit of Adoption, crying</hi> Abba, <hi>Father.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He is called the <hi>Spirit of the Son;</hi> I beſeech you ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, Gal. 4. 6. <hi>Becauſe ye are Sons, God hath ſent forth the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his Son into your Hearts, crying,</hi> Abba, <hi>Father:</hi> Why does he call it the <hi>Spirit of the Son?</hi> But to ſhew, that it is the <hi>Witneſs</hi> coming from Chriſt: If therefore it comes from him, The Great Witneſs of the Spirit is, That we are in Chriſt: It doth not come to us in our own Righteouſneſs; For then, Why ſhould it be called, The <hi>Spirit of the Son?</hi> No, not in our own Sanctification, does it come to us; But it is, The <hi>Spirit of the Son;</hi> And, It's a ſure Teſtimony of its Glorifying Chriſt, in taking the Things that are Chriſt's, and <hi>Giving to us</hi> even in its Teſtimony.</p>
                     <p>You may ſay, This may Deceive us; And we don't know, Whether it is the Spirit, or not?</p>
                     <p>Obſerve what the Apoſtle ſaith, in 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. ſpeaking of <hi>the Witneſs of the Spirit;</hi> (latter part of the 6th Verſe) <hi>And the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Spirit is Truth:</hi> Why does he ſay, <hi>The Witneſs of the Spirit is Truth,</hi> but to meet with the Things that are in our Hearts, that we are ready to ſay: There are other Good Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, we dare not Believe the Spirit alone; But we have other
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41902:74"/> Good Witneſſes, and we muſt bring them in; And if they ſay ſo too, then we may Believe the Spirit, or elſe not.</p>
                     <p>Now the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The Witneſs of the Spirit</hi> is Truth; To let us know, there is a ſeparate ſingle Witneſs of the Spirit of God, that is true.</p>
                     <p>I know no Reaſon at all, That we ſhould be afraid to Affirm this; For, If the Spirit of God dwells (as Generally the Beſt and moſt Judicious Diſcourſers of theſe Things, allow) if the <hi>Spirit of God dwell in us,</hi> Why ſhould it be ſtrange, that the Spirit of God ſhould whiſper its Witneſs in this way? And the Apoſtle ſpeaks of this very <hi>Witneſs,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>The Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Spirit is True:</hi> But then,</p>
                     <p>In the Second Place, I do acknowledge this freely and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, That the Spirit of God doth make uſe of this, or that particular Grace, or Holineſs in general, in a Saint of Chriſt: As he pleaſes, ſometimes he Witneſſeth only by himſelf, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by ſuch and ſuch Graces: And why? Not becauſe the Graces themſelves are alone able to bear up the Witneſs; That I plainly deny. But then,</p>
                     <p>The Spirit <hi>Witneſſeth</hi> not only of Grace, of Faith, of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>And here is that, that I ſaid to you, Chriſt takes any Grace of his Servants, and ſhews it at the Day of Judgment; Not as it is out of himſelf, but as it is in himſelf, and in his own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and by his Spirit; He now ſhews to any of his Servants, any of their Graces, but not as out of Chriſt, but as in Chriſt, ſurrounded, made up, fill'd up with his Righteouſneſs: As I remember the Expreſſion in the Book of <hi>Exodus,</hi> where the Jewels that were in the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> in the <hi>Breast-plate</hi> of the <hi>High-Priest;</hi> Their ſetting is called, <hi>Filling up.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They were filled up in the Gold, the Receptacles and Lodgings of them were <hi>filled up,</hi> Exod. 28. So I ſay, In every Grace, there's the filling up of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Take all the Graces of <hi>Paul,</hi> and of <hi>Peter,</hi> or any of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt; And if they had not been Set in the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt, if there were not a Filling up by the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt, they would all come to nought; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are filled up with his Righteouſneſs.</p>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:41902:75"/>
                     <p>And ſo I do acknowledge, That it may be; That the Spirit of God may give his Servants a Witneſs, and a Teſtimony from their own Graces: And ſo, in 1 <hi>John 4. 17. Herein</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is our Love made perfect, That we may have Boldneſs in the Day of Judgment; Becauſe as he is, ſo are we in this World: There is no</hi> Fear in Love, <hi>but perfect Love caſteth out Fear; He that feareth, is not made perfect in Love.</hi> Here the Apoſtle ſpeaks of a Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting, a Diſturbing, and Perplexing Fear: The Power of Love to Chriſt drives it out; Becauſe as <hi>he was, ſo are we in this World;</hi> That is, The more Chriſt is pleaſed to Sanctifie his People, (taking it ſtill for a Sanctification in himſelf) as he is made to us <hi>Wiſdom in our Calling, Righteouſneſs</hi> in our <hi>Juſtification, Holineſs</hi> in our <hi>Sanctification,</hi> and Eternal Glory, ſtiled <hi>Redemption,</hi> all in him, and from him.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall therefore wind up This, in theſe two Brief Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is, You ſee here, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks in another Caſe, <hi>When all is ſpoken, that can be ſpoken, We know</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is but Man;</hi> It is nothing but Man; That is, ſpeaking of the Weakneſs of Man; All that can be ſaid (ſaith he) you have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Weak, Frail Man: And, on the other ſide, (ſpeaking of Chriſt) There's nothing to be ſaid, but this; <hi>He is All, All in All,</hi> we are nothing: Here's the Sum of the Matter; We are No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; all that is in us is Nothing; All that God, or his Spirit hath wrought in us, it is nothing, (if you could take it out of Chriſt) it will be a <hi>Lamp put out in obſcure Darkneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Carry this conſtantly upon your Thoughts; <hi>He that hath the Son, hath Life;</hi> And <hi>he that hath not the Son of God, hath not Life.</hi> We reſt upon nothing, when we reſt upon our ſelves: Let us take him in, who is the Great <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> that <hi>King of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that King of Peace;</hi> Let us never go without him, let us never ſay, Here's ſuch and ſuch a Grace, and ſuch and ſuch a good Action, but let it lead us to the Spring and to the Fountain; If we can but <hi>Chatter,</hi> as <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> the Name of Chriſt; It is the Bleſſed <hi>Name</hi> that is poured forth; It is the <hi>Savour</hi> of the <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> that makes acceptable to God.</p>
                     <p>If we can but only lie down at the Foot of God and Chriſt, and earneſtly beg for his Sake, according to the Great Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Scripture in Prayer; If we want Quickning, if we want Comfort, if we want Humiliation, if we want the Senſe of Sin,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41902:75"/> Sorrow for it; I have no Intention in theſe Diſcourſes, that you ſhould throw theſe Things away, or think lightly of them; But that you ſhould have them all from the Fountain, and in the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, by a continual Union with him, and Communication from him.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, if any of us want any of theſe, the more we ſhould cry to him; If ſuch a Sin grow too hard, and ſuch a Luſt and Corruption will take hold upon us and Domineer in our Souls, whether ſhould we go, but to the Great Redeemer? And when we come to have a continual Converſe with him, and to have all our Graces from him, and in him, conſiſting wholly in him, this will bring us to ſuch a Love, ſuch an Acquaintance with him, that it will caſt out fear; As thoſe that we continually Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with, our Love ariſes far above our Fear, and ſo, when we Converſe thus with Jeſus Chriſt: I beſeech you, that you would take the Name of Chriſt; And if you cannot get your Hearts ſo affected as you deſire, yet let not that Name go, but preſs it upon your Hearts, in Prayer to God through Chriſt; I am ſurely perſwaded, the <hi>Flinty Rock</hi> will be <hi>turned into a Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Water:</hi> If you ſay, How? There's no need to give a Man Satisfaction, if a Man ſlights it, and has no care about this; But if our Souls are indeed and in earneſt Affected, as <hi>Bartimeus,</hi> cry more earneſtly; And if any thing bids you hold your Peace, yet you'll find that it will be ſaid to you, <hi>He calleth thee;</hi> And ſo ſtand up, and lay the Weight and Burden of all upon him, as I ſaid before; <hi>From the Off-ſpring to the Iſſue, from Flagons of great Quantity,</hi> even to <hi>little Cups,</hi> the leaſt Thing in Religion, let all be hung upon this <hi>Nail in the ſure Place:</hi> And then,</p>
                     <p>The Second Thing; Becauſe I deſire ſtill to make mention to you, of the Great and Gladſome Expectation of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of our <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> to come into its Succeſſion; Let us all earneſtly beg, That it may be ſo; And then I am ſure, theſe Things will be cleared, there will be no claſhing then: For the Name of Chriſt will ſwallow up every thing; The Glory of the Doctrine of Chriſt, when a Few years are but over, I make no Queſtion, the Name of Chriſt will ſound ſo loud, that all Things will be drawn up to him, and be united into that Bleſſed, and Excellent Name of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, we will ſay (with which, I'll conclude this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe) <hi>Thy Name is as Oyntment poured forth, therefore do the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins love Thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                           <p>10. And while they <hi>(that is the Fooliſh Virgins)</hi> went to Buy, the Bridegroom came; And they that were Ready, went in with him to the Marriage, and the Door was ſhut.</p>
                           <p>11. Afterward came alſo the other Virgins, ſaying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</p>
                           <p>12. But he anſwered and ſaid; Verily, I ſay unto you, I know you not.</p>
                        </q>
                     </head>
                     <p>I Have paſt through this Parable; And there remain only Two Points, that I propoſed further to Diſcuſs.</p>
                     <p>And that is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> Concerning the Peremptory and Poſitive Anſwer, that our Lord gives the <hi>Fooliſh Virgins;</hi> They cry, <hi>Lord, Lord, open to us;</hi> The Door was ſhut, while they went to Buy, of which, I have ſpoken to you before; And when they <hi>came,</hi> and <hi>knocked,</hi> to have the <hi>Door opened,</hi> the Poſitive and Peremptory Anſwer, that they received, was this; <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you, I know you not.</hi> And then,</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Last</hi> Point is the Application of all; <hi>Watch therefore, for ye know neither the Day, nor the Hour, when the Son of Man cometh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I intend, by the Aſſiſtance of God, to ſpeak to you of the Firſt of theſe two Latter Propoſitions at this time; That is, Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Poſitive Anſwer, <hi>I know you not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Both the Shortneſs, and the Irrevocableneſs, and Irreverſableneſs of it is dreadful; It is in vain any further to make Application; <hi>For, I know you not.</hi> And then,</p>
                     <p>The Phraſe, or the Term in which it is conveyed; It is not in any thing but this; <hi>I know you not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So then, the Propoſition, or Doctrine, that I ſhall lay down to you, is this:</p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:41902:76"/>
                     <p>That it muſt be ſadly acknowledged (and every one is to take it to himſelf,) That a <hi>Virgin,</hi> if a <hi>Fooliſh Virgin,</hi> ſhall not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, nor ſuffered to enter into the Glory of that <hi>Marriage-Feaſt,</hi> that <hi>Marriage-Supper of the Lamb.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For that's the Meaning of the <hi>Door being ſhut,</hi> where a Great Feſtival-Room is, and where thoſe that are Uſhered in as Gueſts, are Received, and Entertained; <hi>The Door is ſhut;</hi> And they that have not a Right to Enter, are for ever Debarred; They cannot Enter; <hi>The Door is ſhut,</hi> and no Entreaty will prevail; Chriſt Anſwers them plainly, That <hi>he knows them not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now therefore, I would propoſe theſe ſeveral Things, to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe to you at this Time.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, I would take notice of our Lord's Language, <hi>I know you not:</hi> And then,</p>
                     <p>In the Second Place, I would open to you, who theſe are (by way of Earneſt preſſing the Conſideration upon you) who theſe are, to whom Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I know you not;</hi> Which may very well Startle and Amaze.</p>
                     <p>In the Third Place, I would Diſcourſe to you, the Reaſons, Why <hi>Fooliſh Virgins</hi> (though <hi>Virgins</hi>) cannot have the <hi>Door open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> to them: And then,</p>
                     <p>In the Fourth Place, I'll Anſwer the Scruples, and Objections, that may ariſe in your Thoughts, againſt the Great Doctrine of the Goſpel, upon this Account: And then,</p>
                     <p>In the Laſt Place, I would conclude with the Application of it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Concerning the Phraſe that is here uſed by Chriſt; And, it is very Remarkable; That whenever Perſons that ſeem to have a Claim, and a Challenge, and a Right to Chriſt, upon the Account of Profeſſion, and upon the beſt Profeſſion, as I ſhall ſhew you; Whenever they make Approach to Chriſt, as if he were miſtaken, he does not conſider who they are that <hi>knock</hi> at the <hi>Door,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him to <hi>open,</hi> yet ſtill, he Repreſents himſelf, and Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates to them, in this very Phraſe, <hi>I know you not;</hi> And ſo I ſhall enter into a Brief Conſideration of the Meaning and Importance of it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That it is the Ordinary, or Stated Phraſe and Manner of Speaking, that Chriſt uſes: <hi>Matt.</hi> 7. in that Great <hi>Sermon</hi> of Chriſt upon <hi>the Mount,</hi> beginning at the 21ſt. Verſe; <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto me, Lord, Lord, ſhall Enter into the Kingdom
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41902:77"/> of Heaven; But he that doth the Will of my Father which is in Heaven: Many will ſay to me in that Day, Lord, Lord, have we not Propheſied in thy Name?</hi> And <hi>in thy Name have cast out Devils, And in thy Name done many Wonderful Works? And then will I profeſs unto them, I never knew you; Depart from me, ye that work Iniquity:</hi> Here's the Language Chriſt uſes.</p>
                     <p>You pretend (ſaith he) to know me, to be of my Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to have a Familiarity with me, and to have many Pledges of my Preſence with you, and of being known to you; But, <hi>I know you not; I never knew you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is a very Dreadful, and Severe Expreſſion, to thoſe that would claim upon Chriſt by former Acquaintance; All of you know, it is the Manner among Men, when any one, that we would have nothing to do with; And (as we ſpeak in our Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Language) that we would ſhake off, when they would deſire to lay a fair Challenge, or a Claim to our Acquaintance, or Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; We tell them, We don't know them: A Perſon comes, and would fain Intereſt himſelf in us; You know, it is an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary thing to ſay, <hi>I don't know you,</hi> or <hi>I have had very little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So, to thoſe that ſay, <hi>Lord, Wilt thou Deny us? Have we not Hear'd? Have we not Preached? Have we not Eat and Drunk in thy Preſence? Have we not Cast out Devils in thy Name? What! Wilt thou ſhake us off? Wilt thou deny that ever thou knew'st us?</hi> Here's the force of the Expreſſion: So, Luke 13. 25. <hi>When once the Maſter of the Houſe is riſen up, and hath ſhut to the Door,</hi> and <hi>ye begin to ſtand without, and to knock, at the Door, ſaying, Lord, Lord, open to us;</hi> And <hi>he ſhall anſwer</hi> and <hi>ſay unto you, I know you not, whence you are: What! Would you that are Strangers, and that I never had any particular Intimacy with, would you have the</hi> Door opened <hi>for you?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then <hi>ſhall ye begin to ſay,</hi> (Ver. 26.) <hi>We have Eaten and Drunk in thy Preſence, and thou hast taught in our Streets; But he ſhall ſay, I tell you, I know you not, whence you are; Depart from me all ye Workers of Iniquity; There ſhall be Weeping and Gnaſhing of Teeth; when ye ſhall ſee</hi> Abraham, <hi>and</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>and all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in the Kingdom of God, and you your Selves thrust out:</hi> So you ſee, it is the Language of Scripture, the very Language of Scripture, <hi>I know you not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:41902:77"/>
                     <p>That we may therefore underſtand the Senſe and the Meaning of it; I ſhall open it in Three Particulars, very briefly:</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is this; There is a <hi>Knowledge</hi> of God from Eternity; A <hi>Knowledge</hi> of Eternal Grace, of Eternal Love; A <hi>Fore-Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> as the Scripture ſpeaks, whom <hi>God hath foreknown,</hi> Rom. 8. A full, and an Excellent Place, to this very Purpoſe; <hi>Whom he did foreknow,</hi> (ver. 29.) <hi>he alſo did predeſtinate</hi> to <hi>be conformed to the Image of his Son,</hi> &amp;c. So there is a <hi>Knowledge</hi> of God from Eternity, of every Perſon.</p>
                     <p>I know, this is a very hard thing to <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> to believe; That God ſhould <hi>Fore-know</hi> ſome, and not <hi>Fore-know</hi> others; And eſpecially, except they can hang it upon the Condition, That God ſhould foreſee, who ſhould Believe, and who ſhould Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: But as I have formerly endeavoured to clear to you, That there is nothing hard, when it comes to be conſidered; And that there are more Saints, upon the Account of this <hi>Fore-knowledge</hi> of God, than if he had never Fore-known at all: For, there might not have been one Saint, according to <hi>Adam</hi>'s Behaviour in <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,</hi> who had far greater Advantages, and yet you know, he was loſt himſelf, and all his Poſterity in him, if a Mediator had not come, and interpoſed.</p>
                     <p>Let a Man therefore be ſet in the beſt or worſt circumſtances you can ſuppoſe; And, I am ſure, there's more particular Hopes from God's <hi>Fore-knowledge</hi> and Purpoſe, than if there had been no <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,</hi> or no <hi>Fore-knowledge</hi> of God, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. So, Chap. 2, 19. The <hi>Foundation of God ſtands ſure:</hi> Why does it ſtand ſure? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (ſaith he) it hath this very <hi>Seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his:</hi> So ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I know my Sheep.</hi> And if we ſhould ſay, Ay, he knew them, becauſe they were already come into him: Saith he, <hi>I have other Sheep, that I have not yet brought in, and that I must bring in, and them I know too:</hi> So that there is a <hi>Knowledge</hi> before the <hi>Foundation of the World,</hi> or coming in.</p>
                     <p>And, undoubtedly, though, as you ſhall ſee, I ſhall endeavour to make the Thing as plain, and as free to your Thoughts, as I can, in the Progreſs of this Diſcourſe; Yet I deſire to <hi>give Glory</hi> to the <hi>Fore-knowledge</hi> of God, and tell you, That it is not your Diſadvantage, but its your great Advantage. I durſt boldly take any Perſon in this Aſſembly, at this Time, and ſay to him, That there's a great deal more Hopes, that <hi>God hath foreknown you,</hi> than that by <hi>your own Strength, you ſhould prevail,</hi> for your own
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41902:78"/> Eternal Happineſs. There's a Notable Expreſſion in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. The Apoſtle begins thus; Saith he, We all <hi>have Knowledge; Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge puffeth up,</hi> but <hi>Charity edifieth: And if any Man think</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know: But if any Man love God, the ſame is known of him.</hi> If any Man comes truly to underſtand God, then he is known of God firſt; and if any Man <hi>Love</hi> God, the ſame is known and <hi>Loved of him</hi> firſt.</p>
                     <p>I do not deny, but theſe Expreſſions may be taken in the Second and Practical Senſe, I ſhall next give you; But I look upon it, That the Apoſtle firſt goes up to the Fountain of Knowledge, to that Spring of All-ſaving Knowledge, God's <hi>Knowing Men,</hi> in his Eternal Love, in and through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>The Second <hi>Knowing</hi> of Men therefore is that, which Men will more eaſily aſſent to, and take down; And that is, When we are in the Ways of Love, and Service, and Obedience to God, then he knows with Approbation, he knows with Delight; God knows every one of us now, we are all well known to him, and all our Ways, and our Thoughts and Actions are all known to him; He knows us a great deal better than we know our ſelves: As he ſpeaks, <hi>Amos</hi> 4. laſt, <hi>He declareth unto Man what is his Thought:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Would you have me Ignorant of your Thoughts, and that you muſt tell them me, or elſe I cannot know them? No, <hi>He declareth unto Man what is his Thought:</hi> He unriddles all our Thoughts, and Purpoſes, and Intentions in us; And ſo he knows us, every one very well: As it is ſaid, John 2. 25. <hi>He needed not that any ſhould teſtifie of Man; For he knew what was in Man; He knoweth our Thoughts afar off.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now, this is a <hi>Knowing</hi> (as Scripture ſpeaks) <hi>afar off,</hi> in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Senſe: He knows our Thoughts, long before we conceive them; He <hi>tells</hi> to Man his Thoughts, that hereafter will ariſe up, and how they will riſe up: As it is ſaid in the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> concerning <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog; Thoughts ſhall come up in thee.</hi> I tell thee, long before thou cameſt into Being; God knows our Thoughts, at the uttermoſt Diſtance: But he knows with Approbation, all thoſe that are his; And, therefore that may be the Senſe of the Form and Expreſſion, of being <hi>known of God:</hi> If any Man <hi>Love God,</hi> he is <hi>known of him:</hi> If any Man be in the Way of Holineſs, and Righteouſneſs, God knows him; He knows him with great Approbation; For ſo Knowledge, in
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41902:78"/> Scripture does ſeveral times ſpeak, Pſal. 1. 6. <hi>For the Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Way of the Righteous; But the Way of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly ſhall Periſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lord knoweth;</hi> That is, He takes delight to Contemplate, as Men deſire to know a Thing, they like, and Love, they ſearch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, by Study, Meditation, and Contemplation; <hi>The Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Way of the Righteous;</hi> He knoweth it ſo, as to delight in it: <hi>Thou most upright, doest weigh the Path of the Just;</hi> As it is ſaid, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.</p>
                     <p>A Third Way of <hi>Knowing</hi> is, The acknowledging of Perſons, at the Day of the <hi>Marriage-Feast;</hi> He knows them, that is, he will <hi>confeſs them:</hi> As Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever denieth me before Men,</hi> him <hi>will I deny; I will not know him:</hi> And <hi>I will confeſs his Name:</hi> If any Man takes care <hi>to watch,</hi> and <hi>to keep his Garments,</hi> and not to defile them, ſaith Chriſt, I will know that Perſon; <hi>I will Confeſs him,</hi> I will not Diſown him; I will not ſay, I do not know him, but I will acknowledge him at that time, Rev. 3. 5. <hi>He that overcometh, the ſame ſhall be clothed in White Raiment;</hi> And, <hi>I will not blot out his Name out of the Book of Life,</hi> but <hi>I will confeſs his Name before my Father, and before his Angels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore here we may find, why Chriſt uſeth this Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>I know you not;</hi> Becauſe the Perſons that were loſt, they were not <hi>known to</hi> God, in his Eternal Love, and Grace, from Everlaſting; And They were never approved by Chriſt, even in their very profeſſing him.</p>
                     <p>And Laſtly, Chriſt is aſhamed to own ſuch Acquaintance, when they ſay to him, Lord, Have we not been often with Thee, in thy Houſe, in thy Ordinances, in Prayer, and Preaching, and Hearing, and in the Lord's Supper, and in all the Duties of thy Worſhip? Lord, <hi>Do'st thou not know us?</hi> Can'ſt thou not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member we were at ſuch and ſuch a Time Hearing, and Receiving the Lord's Supper, and Praying unto Thee? Can'ſt thou not Remember this? And Chriſt is aſhamed, that ever it was ſo, That we not having departed from Iniquity, that we could ever make a Pretence to him; That we could ever ſay, That he had any thing to do with us, or we with him: And ſo I have diſpatcht the Firſt Particular, to open to you the Senſe of theſe Words, <hi>I know you not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I come to the Second, And that is, of the Perſons, of whom it is ſaid, <hi>I never knew you, I know you not;</hi> They are <hi>Virgins,</hi> tho <hi>fooliſh,</hi>
                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:41902:79"/> And certainly, it ſpeaks the higheſt Reach that any one can make without True Grace, that is ſpoken of here: This muſt be ſaid, and acknowledged, though I confeſs, it is one of the Dreadfulleſt Things that I know in Scripture, and the moſt Diſcouraging, as it may ſeem, in the Ways of Religion; That Chriſt ſhould ſay of Perſons that have been <hi>Virgins,</hi> That he doth not <hi>know</hi> that there hath been ſuch a particular Acquaintance, and (as it were) Endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between Chriſt and them; They owned themſelves to him, and to be his; And yet for all that, he ſhould ſay, <hi>I know you not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They are the higheſt Attainers in Chriſtianity, and in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of God, in Natural, or in Revealed Religion, and yet Chriſt ſays, <hi>I know you not:</hi> I'll give you a little clearing of this to you, a Luſtre of this Truth upon your Minds, in very great briefneſs.</p>
                     <p>Firſt therefore, I would conſider Perſons that are Profane and Wicked, and that live looſly, under the whole Heavens, Let their Religion be what it will, They that are Cruel and Unjuſt, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful; They that are Intemperate and Senſual, and Debauched; They that are Profane, and Contemners of God, according to the Light, that they have, let it be what it will, it is no wonder, that Chriſt ſhould ſay to them, <hi>I know you not, I never knew any of you;</hi> You by your Profeſſion of the Name, (called <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taniſm,</hi> or by the Name of this or that <hi>Paganiſm</hi>) What have I to do with you? As God ſaith to his People, <hi>You have I known above all the Families of the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. As if God ſhould ſay, I do not know the <hi>Heathen,</hi> or <hi>Pagan,</hi> or obſtinate <hi>Jew;</hi> Becauſe he never came into the Profeſſion of my Name: But now, one would think the Name of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſhould Envelop, ſhould gather all within Salvation and Happineſs, that they that Name <hi>the Name of Jeſus Christ,</hi> as a Saviour and Redeemer, and <hi>Call upon</hi> it, <hi>ſhould be Saved.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But yet even among <hi>Chriſtians</hi> there are ſuch kind of Perſons as are Blaſphemers, Common Swearers, Common Drunkards, Common Impure Perſons, Covetous, Extortioners, Unmerciful, Unjuſt, Idolaters; And of theſe it is no wonder Chriſt ſhould ſay to ſuch, <hi>I know you not:</hi> Even Natural Conſcience will Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie Chriſt in that, in ſaying, <hi>I know you not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it ſeems hard, when Perſons profeſſing the Name of Chriſt, Sober, that had lived better than others. when they have not an
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41902:79"/> Acknowledgment and owning from Jeſus Chriſt: And therefore it is worthy our Conſideration, that we read of, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. of the <hi>young Man</hi> that had <hi>done every thing;</hi> when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments were reckoned up and repeated to him, ſaith he, <hi>All theſe have I kept from my youth.</hi> He was ſo ſober a man, ſo juſt a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>what lack I yet?</hi> ſays he: Here was a plain, good Liver, a man of a good Life: You know it is very much ſpoken of, <hi>a Good Life, a Good Life.</hi> And, it is true, it ought to be required, and every one ought to mind this of himſelf; nothing can be ſpoken in derogation or diminution to it, in it ſelf; And yet, this <hi>young man,</hi> that had kept all this, and was ſo good, that Chriſt <hi>looked upon him, and loved him;</hi> He ſaw a great amiableneſs and lovelineſs in his Perſon and Deportment; And yet for all this, Chriſt intimates very ſeverely; he animadverts, and makes very harſh notes upon this Perſon; when Chriſt propoſes <hi>to ſell all, he went away ſorrowful.</hi> And Chriſt makes this ſharp Remark upon him; With great difficulty <hi>ſuch men ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; Verily, I ſay unto you, it is hardly poſſible, that a rich man ſhould enter into the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> Nay, though he be ſuch a <hi>good Liver.</hi> If a man that is look'd upon as a Religious Man, and that makes a great Figure in the World, and that God hath bleſt; Now this Man living ſo ſober, in regard of all the Commandments in outward acts (<hi>all theſe commandments have I kept from my youth up.</hi>) One would think, it were not poſſible, that ſuch a Man ſhould not go to Heaven: And yet, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you,</hi> with relation to this <hi>lovely young man, it is a hard thing for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Certainly he did not come up to that, was properly the <hi>Virgin</hi>-ſtate in the acknowledgment of Chriſt, however he was of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted, unblameable external converſation; he had too, an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of Chriſt as a very Excelling man and a Great Maſter of Divine Knowledg; but He had not a Senſe of his Divine Glory, nor the very power of Chriſtianity ſo as to Graſp the Inſide of it, to Lay Hold upon the very Spirit and Life of it, as in Chriſt, and ſo to deveſt Himſelf of every thing for Chrſt, if Called to it; Nay he was unwilling to Own, and Follow Chriſt, in the very Outward Profeſſion and herein he came ſhort of the <hi>Fooliſh Virgins,</hi> who yet Fall ſhort of Heaven; and therefore Chriſt preaches upon him this General Doctrine; <hi>How Hard is it for a Rich man to Enter into the Kingdom of Heaven!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:41902:80"/>
                     <p>In the Third place, I might Name to you the men of <hi>Tradition,</hi> the men of Superſtition; that look upon it as their Glory, and Security for Heaven, to add many things to the Commands of God, and of Chriſt, as if they either exceeded, or made more perfect, or more beautiful, decent and honourable, the Religion of Divine Inſtitution, by their own ſuper-added obſervations; but this needs not to be much inſiſted upon; becauſe Chriſt hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared from the Word of God in the Old Teſtament by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Eſay, This People draw nigh to me with their Lips, but their hearts are far from me; But in vain do they worſhip me, teaching for Doctrines the commandmens of men,</hi> Matth. 15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But now, theſe <hi>Virgins,</hi> as they hold the Truth, ſo the purity of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Goſpel; and were alſo of an unblameable outward Converſation, as was before opened concerning the <hi>Virgin</hi> State: From all this, we may plainly perceive, it is a very nice Caſe, to diſtinguiſh either in Doctrine or in Practice, between <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> enlivened, with <hi>Wiſdom;</hi> and <hi>Virginity,</hi> that hath the <hi>dead Fly of Folly</hi> in it.</p>
                     <p>I come therefore to the Third Head of Diſcourſe, to give you the Reaſons of this, even Tremendous Diſpenſation of God; <hi>That there ſhould be</hi> Virgins, <hi>and yet Fooliſh Virgins:</hi> For to ſpeak the very bottom and foundation of the matter: This Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of our Lords, of the Caſe of Souls or Spirits not accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt, compared with the Apoſtles Expreſſion, of <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting them as chaſt Virgins to Chriſt;</hi> and yet that ſome <hi>Virgins</hi> preſented to him, he <hi>charges,</hi> according to thoſe expreſſions in <hi>Job, with folly;</hi> It ſeems to carry an Alluſion in a ſpiritual ſence, to that Caſe, <hi>Deut. 24. 1, &amp;c.</hi> Thoſe that are eſpouſed as <hi>Virgins</hi> to Chriſt, and yet they are <hi>not clean in his ſight,</hi> they are for ever, eternally ſeparated from him, even <hi>divorced</hi> from him; He ſends them a Renunciation, a <hi>Bill of Divorcement</hi> from himſelf; This is dreadfully ſtupendious.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Two Accounts I would give hereof according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, why there is ſuch a ſeverity of the Goſpel towards thoſe, who are <hi>Virgins,</hi> and are found <hi>fooliſh Virgins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt would hereby Remonſtrate to us the great Corruption and Depravation of Human Nature; we do not enough apprehend, what a Nature, and what Hearts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we carry about us; <hi>Hearts deceitful above all things;</hi> and <hi>deſperately wicked, who can know them!</hi> It is ſtrange, ſo excellent,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41902:80"/> ſo pure a thing as a <hi>Virgin State</hi> ſhould be defiled, and made wholly unacceptable to Chriſt by <hi>Folly;</hi> our Lord therefore, hereby calls upon us, to be aware what Natures and Hearts we bear about with us; ſince that very time, that <hi>God made Man <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right</hi> in <hi>Knowledge, Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>true Holineſs,</hi> and he defiled his Nature with the <hi>folly</hi> of <hi>many inventions;</hi> The Nature of Man Taints, and defiles every thing, even <hi>Virginity</hi> it ſelf; though not by a falſe Religion; a falſe Worſhip, or groſly polluted Converſation, yet by the <hi>folly</hi> of inſincerity, and want of the Treaſure of Grace ſtanding in Union to Chriſt: This ſhould carry us to fear our own Hearts, <hi>Bleſſed is the Man that feareth always, but he that truſteth in his own heart is a Fool;</hi> he <hi>deceiveth himſelf,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith; <hi>Many ways ſeem right enough in our own Eyes,</hi> but the <hi>iſſue</hi> and <hi>end thereof is death. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> warns, <hi>Paſs the time of our ſojourning here in fear;</hi> and as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>be jealous over our ſelves,</hi> leaſt while we think, we <hi>preſent our ſelves as chaſt Virgins to Chriſt,</hi> that we are Eſpouſed to him, there ſhould be any <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Chriſt is one moſt ſingle, ſimple Jeſus, without Multiplicity; as in Doctrine and Worſhip, ſo in our Union to him, whoever miſſes him in that uncompounded Faith, and undivided Affection, defiles the <hi>Virgin-State,</hi> and looſes the Glory and Purity of it: You may be <hi>Virgins</hi> as to the Chaſtity of Profeſſion, and outward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; and yet you may looſe the Wiſdom of <hi>Virginity;</hi> if there be not a ſingleneſs of Eye and Heart to Chriſt, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be but in Union to himſelf; from thence ariſes the <hi>ſimplicity</hi> that is in Chriſt, and our conformity to it.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Second</hi> Reaſon, why ſo ſevere and dreadful a Diſpenſation is offered to you in this Parable, that I ſhall now give you is, That we might learn Three great Leſſons from it; it is not to diſcourage, or beat you off from your Profeſſion, but that you may <hi>bow down your Ears</hi> and Hearts to theſe three things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That you may depend upon the Free Grace of Electing Love; every one ought to humble himſelf, ond to lie in the Duſt before God in the ſence of this, <hi>It is not of him that willeth, or of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth Mercy: And who art thou, Oh Man! that replieſt againſt God:</hi> All this ſpeaks the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of lying low before God, in the ſence of this ſupream Grace. And what can tend more thus to humble us, that to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41902:81"/> 
                        <hi>Virgins</hi> may be <hi>Virgins,</hi> and yet <hi>Fooliſh Virgins!</hi> This ſhould make us look to a Love and Grace above and beyond any thing in our ſelves, or that is wrought in our ſelves; we ſhould keep our Eye on this: The Apoſtle after the Deſcription of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Apoſtacy,</hi> retires to Election; <hi>God hath choſen us to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:</hi> This is not to draw off our minds from any of thoſe Graces, that are the fruits of Election, but to carry up our Minds above them, to the Fountain of them: And there is no greater aſſurance of the Truth of Grace, than to look up to Electing Grace; <hi>Knowing Brethren, your Election of God, and giving di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in</hi> every Grace, <hi>to make our Calling and Election ſure:</hi> The Apoſtle hath given us a great Admonition for Adoring Supream Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 32, &amp;c. <hi>God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all:</hi> (That is, upon all that he will <hi>have mercy upon: He hath ſhut them up in ſuch a way,</hi> that they could not ſtir, if his Grace did not open the way.) <hi>O the depth of the Riches, both of the Wiſdom and Knowledge of God! how unſearchable are his judgments, and his ways paſt finding out! For who hath known the Mind of the Lord, or who hath been his Counſeller?</hi> Who could direct God what he ſhould do in the eternal concernments of Souls? Or, <hi>Who hath firſt given to him, and it ſhall be recompenced unto him again?</hi> Can any ſay to God, Thou haſt done unjuſtly or unrighteouſly, that thou haſt not choſen me? Why, what haſt thou done, or any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture done to oblige him? If he hath, I dare aſſure him, it ſhall be <hi>recompenced</hi> to him to the uttermoſt. But I aſſure him, he that replies thus, he is a <hi>Bold Man:</hi> and <hi>Proud</hi> and <hi>Haughty, is his Name.</hi> And, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them to Babes. For of him, and through him, and to him are all things; to whom be Glory for ever.</hi> And therefore I deſire to be among the number of thoſe, that do not quarrel with God; That dare not enter a conteſt, and a contention with him, concerning his Eternal Choice; Let us humble our ſelves, every one at his foot, and ſay, <hi>Of thee, and through thee, and to thee are all things,</hi> and I deſire to be to thy Glory. Thus let us make our ſelves nothing before God, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, but make him all. We never did any thing for him, we could never lay an Obligation, and therefore, we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay, but <hi>Free Grace, Free Grace; Free Love,</hi> and <hi>Free foreknowledge of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="69" facs="tcp:41902:81"/>2. In the Second Place, This Parable in this dreadful part teaches, That we ſhould all be beholding to Chriſt, and to the Free Grace that is in him, the Pardon of Sin, the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, his Bloud, and his Redemption: Here's our all, I ſay, here is our all. For, as I opened to you, the Great Point is, Whether in Chriſt or not? Whether Chriſt be in us, and whether we are in him? Whether we are <hi>found in him,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Phil. 3. 7, &amp;c.</hi> Here's the Point, That every one may depend upon the <hi>Righteouſneſs of God in Chriſt.</hi> It is not the <hi>works that we have done;</hi> but <hi>according to his own mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Spirit.</hi> And here the <hi>wiſe Virgins</hi> reached out themſelves to be found in Chriſt, and <hi>only in him;</hi> but the <hi>Fooliſh Virgins</hi> fell ſhort here.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We can do nothing but by the Spirit of Chriſt. Our only hope is in the <hi>Spirit of the Lord our God;</hi> And therefore the <hi>fooliſh Virgins</hi> were miſtaken, That they did all in their own ſtrength and power: They truſted in their own Beauty; they truſted in their own <hi>Virginity,</hi> and did not mind the <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Christ,</hi> the Free Grace of God, and the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>I come to the <hi>Fourth</hi> thing I propoſed, and that is, To anſwer the <hi>Objections</hi> that may be made againſt this ſtate of this Caſe I have given you; And, I deſire to ſpeak plainly, yet in very ſhort to you, in this matter: You may ſay then, <hi>What can any one do? What hope can there be? Though I am in the True Religion, and in the True Worſhip of God; and though I am in an unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Converſation, and yet I may be lost and undone, becauſe I have not Wiſdom, becauſe I have not ſomething that I am not able to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, or to be ſenſible of.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now therfore, I'll ſatisfie you in this; becauſe you may think, In all Religion, there lies a diſcouragement upon us, If things be thus; Therefore I'll Anſwer you in Two things, very briefly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let no man miſtake, for I am ſure, Let any thing be preached that can be preached, yet there ſhall not ſo much as be one Moral Perſon fewer in the World: I am ſure, that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Reſtraining Grace, of Preventing Grace, of Morallizing Grace, that God will give to the World, nothing of Diſcourſe, or Opinion ſhall be able to ſtraiten it, or to leſſen it. I ſay, I am ſure of this; There ſhall not be one Honeſt Man in the World leſs, becauſe Chriſt preached to that <hi>young Man</hi> that had <hi>kept all
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41902:82"/> the Commandments from his youth;</hi> Thou art yet under a great difficulty, <hi>as to the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> A man might have taken the Advantage of that diſcourſe of Chriſt with this <hi>young man,</hi> and have made a Clamour, and noiſe of it, and ſaid, here's one that deſpiſes, and diſcourages a good <hi>young man:</hi> for he ſaith, <hi>How hardly ſhall ſuch a young man,</hi> that hath <hi>kept</hi> all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands from his youth, <hi>enter into the Kingdom of Heaven?</hi> but Chriſt knew very well, that he ſhould not hinder, or leſſen, or ſtraiten Moral Honeſty, or Goodneſs in the World by what he ſaid; for he knew all theſe things are in God, and from God; and there ſhall not one <hi>hair</hi> from the head of Morality (as I may ſo ſpeak) <hi>Fall to the Ground,</hi> becauſe of any thing that can be ſaid; for, There is a Common Grace of Morality and Honeſty given out from God, and Chriſt, and whomſoever he thinks fit to Receive it, They ſhall receive it, and muſt receive it, and they ſhall be under the power of it, and live ſuitably to it: And ſo for the Grace of God, There ſhall no one be hindred of his Graee; Let men have as many Conceptions, as they can have of things, and however Diſcouraging; if his Truth be duely ſpoken and in the ſeaſon; Therefore dont think, that the preaching of the Truth of Scripture can do any hurt: for, God is allwayes preſent, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Word, both with a Spirit of Morality, and common Gifts of Righteouſneſs, and alſo with a Spirit of Grace; and none ſhall be ever able to ſtraighten his Spirit, in any of the Effects of it: And the Truths of God ſpoken according to his Word ſhall be ſubordinated to it.</p>
                     <p>In the Second Place; I do always acknowledge and Declare, with Greateſt Freedom, and Sincerity, That this is the onely way of Preaching the Goſpel; To preach it ſo, that Every one ſhould be Senſible of True Holineſs and True Grace; And yet withal, They muſt be Senſible of Free Grace, the free Grace of God, the free Choice of God: Free Grace in the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, of the <hi>Spirit Blowing where it liſteth,</hi> and where it pleaſeth, as our Lord tells us. Theſe things are not to be Divided nor Juſtled out one by another; for they both ſtand fair in the Wiſdom of God; and they are both to be offered to the Minds and Conſciences of men; and they ſhall both work Effectually for the great ends and purpoſes, that God hath appointed: And, as (as Chriſt ſaith) <hi>If any one be offended, let them be offended;</hi> Why? <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, every Plant which my Heavenly Father hath not planted, ſhall
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41902:82"/> be rooted up.</hi> That is, there ſhall be no Plant loſt, but what God leaves to it ſelf, in his juſt and righteous Judgment; That is, A Moral Man, and an Honeſt Man, and a Sober Man, ſo by the Grace of God, he ſhall be ſo ſtill; God hath choſen and mark'd him out, to be ſuch a one. And he that is truly good, he ſhall be ſo. And yet, all this ſhall be conveyed in the power of Preaching, and in ſuch kind of Threatnings and Promiſes, ſuch kind of Expoſtulations, as Scriptures ſpeak; and therefore, I would not have you think, that theſe things ſhould be put to a Jarre by any Mens Preaching; for every one is under the righteous Government of God: Now therefore, let Truths run ever, according to the Word of God, let them run freely, as a ſtream from Free Grace; Let them then, be with all the Freeneſs and Publickneſs ſpoken of, that can be.</p>
                     <p>And, as it is ſaid in <hi>Exodus</hi> 14. There was a <hi>Pillar of Cloud,</hi> and <hi>a Pillar of Fire,</hi> in one; And the <hi>Pillar of Cloud</hi> was turned, that is, the <hi>dark ſide</hi> was turned upon the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and the light ſide upon the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> So I ſay, when the Word of God is preached, the Light ſide ſhall be upon the perſon that God will have a ſober, honeſt, righteous, good man; and the <hi>dark ſide</hi> ſhall be upon the diſſolute, and upon the prophane, and upon the intemperate; And ſo the <hi>dark ſide</hi> ſhall be upon them, that God leaves to themſelves, and the <hi>Light ſide</hi> ſhall be upon thoſe, that God will bring under his Grace, and under his Spirit, and under the Power of Holineſs.</p>
                     <p>And ſo I have Diſcourſed the Doctrinal part of this great Point to you; and I hope, ſo, That none of you ſhould have any juſt cauſe of being offended, at what I have ſpoken; but that it ſhould engage every one of us to run up to Grace, and to Chriſt; for the hopes are greater that I have laid down to you out of the Scriptures, wherein our Springs lie then when they call upon us for our own Action and Duty; And when they do ſo, they ſhew us the great neceſſity of Chriſt, of the Spirit of Chriſt, of Free Grace. For, don't we ſee, Men are Preaching up Free-Will and Works as much as they can? And yet for all that, was there ever ſo much prophaneneſs and wickedneſs, was there ever any leſs Power and Life of the Goſpel, ſince the <hi>Reformation</hi> than now there is? And therefore, though the Pulpits be full of this, yet we don't ſee the powerful Grace of God go along ſo, that we have reaſon to rejoice at ſuch Preaching; but thoſe that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41902:83"/> Preach the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt without Works, and ſet forth the fulneſs of Free Grace, and of the Supream Dominion of God, and yet in a way of Holineſs, I can remember and trace back, That there were great effects of this; Mens Lives were mightily Changed and Reformed; They were mightily chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, notwithſtanding that this Preaching was endeavoured to be ſtifled and ſtopt; There were many effects, both in City and Country, in bringing Men to God and to Chriſt, by that Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſo there are ſtill; and therefore to cloſe all in the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the <hi>Firſt</hi> Place; I would earneſtly beſeech you, That you would prize this Grace: And Oh! that God would be pleaſed to turn the <hi>Bright-ſide</hi> of what I have now ſpoken on, and that you would go into your ſecret Cloſets and Meditations, and lay your ſelves low before God, and acknowledge the freeneſs of God's Grace; <hi>One have I choſen, and another have I left:</hi> Be not afraid of this, I ſay, it ſhall do you no hurt at all; God may make it a time of Love; And the more you depend upon Grace, upon the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, the more holineſs; and the more you ſhall find the Power and Breathing of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt upon you. And therefore, Remember the Three things whereupon we ſtand, <hi>viz.</hi>

In the Second Place, <hi>Let not</hi> (from all that I have ſpoken) <hi>any think That any thing will be accepted, without ſincerity of Grace.</hi> For, where-ever there hath been the Love of God, or the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt, that hath taken hold of any ones State and Condition; and where the Spirit of God hath taken hold upon any ones heart, there ſhall be ſure to be the mighty Effect of Grace, and Holineſs and Spirituality; and, that in a Man's own action, he ſhan't lie ſtill, and ſay, <hi>I'll ſee what God will work upon me,</hi> but he ſhall be <hi>up and be up and be doing, becauſe the Lord is with him:</hi> He ſhall be active and full of motion, ſtriving, and full of induſtry; becauſe the <hi>Light-Side</hi> of the Scripture is upon him, and he is kept from every thing that offends; His <hi>foot ſhall not be taken</hi> (as Scripture ſaith) while he holds himſelf cloſe, in dependance upon <hi>Free Grace,</hi> upon the free Choice
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41902:83"/> and Election of Grace: I am ſure, you ſhall not be aſhamed, if God move your hearts, and if the <hi>Light-Side</hi> of Scripture be upon you in theſe things; you ſhall find God will be your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and your ſure and <hi>ſtrong hold;</hi> his Name in theſe things ſhall be <hi>your strong Tower,</hi> to which ye ſhall <hi>run and be ſafe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Third</hi> Place, I deſire you would give me but one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments time, to move you to beg for the Coming of the <hi>Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and for the Time, it ſhall firſt be preparing for its Glory; and which I have declared to be ſo near, upon ſo great Ground of Scripture.</p>
                     <p>Now, I would give you Ground of earneſtly begging for this <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> and the ſucceſſion of it; And why? Becauſe there ſhall be great Converting Grace, bringing in Strangers to God and to Chriſt; There ſhall be a greater Power in bringing men to the Purity and Simplicity that is in Chriſt: Then many <hi>fooliſh Virgins</hi> yet, ſhall be made <hi>wiſe;</hi> many not <hi>Virgins</hi> yet, ſhall be Eſpouſed to Chriſt: And, if you ſay, Why was not this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways? The Anſwer that I ſhall give you is this:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is in the power of God to diſpence Grace as he pleaſes:</hi> You may as well ſay, Why had not our fore-Fathers the Goſpel, as pure as we have? Why had they not the Scripture ſo clear? And why had they it not in their own Language, Two or Three, or Four or Five Hundred Years ago? It was a dangerous thing within theſe Two Hundred Years, to have the <hi>Bible</hi> in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> in their Houſes: Then it was a certain ſign, That that Man was in danger of his Life, to have it ſo. Why did not God give it with that freedom, as we have it? And then, if you look back to Sixteen Hundred Years ago, there was nothing in the World at large, but <hi>Idols,</hi> and <hi>ſerving of Devils:</hi> And the Goſpel was not Preached: Till after the Apoſtles Times, it did not come into theſe Iſlands of <hi>Britain.</hi> It is not for us to know how to Rule and to Govern <hi>Times and Seaſons;</hi> But God hath diſpoſed of every thing; <hi>Bleſſed are your Eyes, for you ſee, and your Ears, for they hear.</hi> But I would but only give you one or two Scriptures, of the great advantage, if we ſhould but live to ſee the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt: And therefore, I beſeech you all, That you would earneſtly pray, That that Kingdom may be coming forth. In the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> if you obſerve the reading at the <hi>15th Verſe,</hi> you ſhall find, that there was a <hi>Book</hi> offered, and <hi>the Learned ſaid, it was ſealed;</hi> and therefore, ſay they, <hi>How can
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41902:84"/> we read it? And the unlearned ſaid, we cannot read it, for we are not learned:</hi> If learned Men cannot read it, how ſhould we read it? But ſaith God, in the following part of the <hi>Chapter, This very Book ſhall be opened, it ſhall come to paſs in that day</hi> (that is, when the Kingdom of Chriſt ſhall come) <hi>The deaf ſhall hear the words of the Book, and the eyes of the blind ſhall ſee out of obſcurity,</hi> and <hi>out of darkneſs;</hi> that is, There ſhall be ſo mighty a change of things, that that Book that the <hi>learned,</hi> and the <hi>unlearned</hi> could not meddle with, the very <hi>deaf ſhall hear the Words of this Book:</hi> It is a very won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Scripture to this purpoſe, it ſhews us plainly the great things, that ſhall be done by God at that Day: And I make no doubt, but that theſe Scriptures, that Men are afraid that any ſhould med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with, and they think it Preſumption; And how ſhould we meddle with ſuch hard Scriptures? I make no doubt, but the <hi>Eyes of the blind ſhall ſee out of obſcurity, and out of darkneſs.</hi> And ſo <hi>Iſa. 35. 8. And an high way ſhall be there, and a way, and it ſhall be called the way of holineſs; the unclean ſhall not paſs over it, but it ſhall be for thoſe. The way-faring men, though fools, ſhall not err in that way;</hi> So great a Light of the Goſpel ſhall ſhine out. Pray, therefore, don't be ſo againſt the Preaching of the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> in your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or in your Diſcourſes; but rather bow your Knees, and buckle your hearts, and your thoughts down to the very loweſt at the <hi>Throne of Grace,</hi> to deſire, that this <hi>Kingdom may come.</hi> Why do you envy one another the great Happineſs that ſhall be in the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt?</hi> For, a great Offspring, like the <hi>Drops of Dew from the Womb of the Morning,</hi> muſt at that time be brought home to Chriſt: And many of thoſe that are <hi>Virgins</hi> but in Form muſt come to have it in the Truth and Reality, and Sincerity of it. And therefore, let us earneſtly pray, according to that Prayer, ſtiled the <hi>Lords Prayer;</hi> Let us with earneſtneſs and underſtanding, pray, <hi>Thy Kingdom, O Lord, let it come,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>I Come now to the Uſe, or (as we ſpeak) Application, which our Lord makes of this Great and Excellent <hi>Parable, Watch,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41902:84"/> for you know neither the day nor the hour, in which the Son of Man cometh:</hi> And it may be, upon the hearing of the Words, you may be ready to ſay, That I am upon a Scripture that overthrows the Attempts of drawing ſuch a <hi>Scripture Line of Time,</hi> as I have endeavoured to hold out, and to perſwade the Truth of, as ſhould lead to the very <hi>Coming of the Bridegroom,</hi> the <hi>great Son of Man.</hi> But indeed, the intention of it, as I ſhall ſhew you, is quite ano<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther thing, and does not concern it ſelf in that matter, either one way or other: The main Point in it is that great practical one, <hi>That every one of us ought to be upon our Guard, upon our Watch, while we are here in the World, in relation to that great Appearance of our Lord Jeſus Christ:</hi> We are to wait all our days accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our opportunity of enjoying the Goſpel, in the compaſs of Time God gives us, which may, as you know, be longer, or ſhorter, as our Lives are in the diſpoſe of God; he may take us away this very Night, if he pleaſes; and yet for all this, we muſt have made ſuch a proviſion, and preparation for the <hi>Coming of the Bridegroom;</hi> which will elſe be with a dreadful and ruinous ſurpriſe upon us whenſoever it be: We are infinitely obliged (give me leave to uſe ſo great a Word, in ſo great a Point) we are, I ſay, infinitely obliged therefore, to take heed in ſo great a matter; If it was as many Years to the <hi>Coming of Chriſt,</hi> as it hath been ſince he ſpake theſe Words, and though we were ſure it would be ſo: That therefore, which I will propoſe to open to you, ſhall be ſumm'd in this main Doctrine:</p>
                     <p>Doct. <hi>Every one that hears the Word of the Goſpel, concerning the</hi> Coming <hi>and</hi> Kingdom of Chriſt (<hi>take it in your own ſenſe as much as you pleaſe) is bound to</hi> watch, <hi>as if it might be the very next Day and Hour; yea though he had lived in the days of Chriſt, and had then known certainly, that that</hi> Coming <hi>and</hi> Kingdom, <hi>ſhould not have been in ſo many Ages as have run out ſince.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the knowing <hi>what Day, or Hour,</hi> is not a knowing, or not knowing by Computation, or Account of Time; but by an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual providing a <hi>Treaſure of Oil,</hi> that we may not be found <hi>fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Virgins</hi> at that day. Our watchful <hi>knowing</hi> is <hi>knowing</hi> by Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the great <hi>Son of Oil,</hi> Chriſt himſelf: And if any Man did know never ſo certainly, the preciſe time of the <hi>Coming</hi> of the <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> yet he would not know, in our Lord's ſence, at what <hi>hour</hi> he'll come, but would be in the ſame ſurpriſe, as if he knew nothing at all: That Day moſt certainly comes unawares, upon all <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:41902:85"/> with furfeiting and drunkenneſs, and Cares of this Life;</hi> upon all that <hi>ſleep,</hi> and are not watchful by Faith and Holineſs; It comes at <hi>a day when it is not looked for, and at an hour the evil ſervant is not aware, who eats and drinks with the drunken;</hi> They only know that day, whoſe Loins are girded, and whoſe <hi>Lights are burning,</hi> who, <hi>when their Lord cometh, upon account of the Wedding, open to him immediately; Bleſſed are thoſe ſervants, whom their Lord when he cometh, ſhall find ſo doing; Verily, ſaith Chriſt, he will gird himſelf, and will make them ſit down to Meat, and will ſerve them; be ye therefore ready; for the Son of Man cometh at an hour ye think not;</hi> that is, <hi>if you are not ready;</hi> For the very ſence of <hi>knowing,</hi> or not <hi>knowing the time,</hi> is being <hi>ready</hi> or not <hi>ready;</hi> if not <hi>ready, we are not aware.</hi> The <hi>knowing</hi> of time, or not <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> is but the cover and outſide of this true, effective <hi>knowing,</hi> or not ſo <hi>knowing.</hi>

                     <p>I will therefore, firſt endeavour to open to you the true ſtate of this thing, and then lay down to you ſeveral particular Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for the right Exerciſe of this <hi>Watch:</hi> And in a Second Head, give you the Arguments of Perſuaſion to this <hi>Watch,</hi> and ſo cloſe the whole with Application.</p>
                     <p>1. To ſhew you then in the Firſt Place, the true ſence of this great Propoſition, from this our Lord's Application of the <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi> And in the general, You know the Concluſion of a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is the Practical Application; and that you know, is regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly drawn out of the main ſubſtance of it: This Application is then drawn out of the ſubſtance of the <hi>Parable;</hi> and that moſt evidently, is the having <hi>Oil in our Veſſels,</hi> as hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd: The <hi>watching</hi> is therefore, our looking well to that, <hi>having Oil in our Veſſels;</hi> for they <hi>watch'd,</hi> who were ſo <hi>ready,</hi> though the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> delaying his <hi>coming,</hi> they <hi>ſlumbred,</hi> and lay down in Death; they did not <hi>watch,</hi> who ſo <hi>ſlumbred,</hi> and went out of the World by Death, that they had not a proviſion ready for the <hi>Bridegrooms Coming;</hi> ſo that the <hi>knowing</hi> or not <hi>knowing the Time,</hi> is not at all touched upon; But more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, to attain our Lord's ſence in the moſt plain and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal inſtances of a Spiritual Life, according to the Goſpel, as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to <hi>watching.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Look diligently, that we are taken out of the <hi>Gall of Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs,</hi> and from under the <hi>Bond of Iniquity,</hi> That we are taken out of the ſtate of <hi>Children of Wrath,</hi> by being <hi>implanted into Chriſt,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41902:85"/> and tranſlated into the Kingdom of his dear Son, in whom is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption in his Bloud, even the forgiveneſs of ſins, according to the riches of his Grace;</hi> that we <hi>awake from that ſleep,</hi> and <hi>ſtand up from the dead, that Chriſt may give us life:</hi> Let us look well, that we are brought into the State of Grace; for that is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal and fundamental Point of <hi>Watching,</hi> and the Eſſential Difference between a <hi>wiſe</hi> and a <hi>fooliſh Virgin;</hi> to be brought into Chriſt; and to have his Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Let us be continually <hi>carneſt, and fervent in Prayer; watch unto Prayer,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 7. And as our Lord commands, <hi>Watch and pray, that you may be accounted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to eſcape all theſe things, and to ſtand before the Son of Man at his Coming,</hi> Luke 21. 36. Pray earneſtly with importunate Crys, that you may not be given over, and found in a ſtate of Ruine and Condemnation at that Great Day. Chriſt was <hi>whole Nights in Prayer; with ſtrong Crys and Tears, he offered up Supplications unto him that was able to ſave him from death, and was heard in that he feared;</hi> And how then ſhould we think to meet him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that exerciſe; let us therefore be <hi>inſtant in Prayer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Let us be very diligent in meditating on the Word of God, <hi>Bleſſed is the Man that meditates in his Law day and night; that's watching, to meditate day and night;</hi> and whereas Chriſt ſays, <hi>I know you not,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord knows the way</hi> of ſuch holy, righteous ſervants of his, through his Grace in Chriſt: And it is an evidence of being in him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Let us ſhew our <hi>watching,</hi> by <hi>keeping</hi> our ſelves from our iniquity, and from all the Temptations to it; <hi>Watch and pray,</hi> (ſaith our Lord) <hi>that ye enter not into Temptation,</hi> Luke 22. 43. <hi>Be ſober</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Peter) and watch unto Prayer; Gird up the loins of your mind, and hope perfectly, for the glory that ſhall be brought to you at the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 13. with <hi>c. 4. 7. And be ſober, be vigilant, or watchful, for your Adverſary the Devil, goeth about like a roaring Lion, ſeeking whom he may devour,</hi> c. 5, 2. All this ſhews the great Watchfulneſs our Souls ſhould maintain againſt <hi>our own Iniquity,</hi> that we may be <hi>upright before him,</hi> and not be as <hi>fooliſh Virgins.</hi> And it is the more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing, that in like Diſcourſes of our Lords with this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when he diſcovers ſuch <hi>fooliſh Virgins,</hi> he ſays, <hi>Depart from me, ye that work iniquity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. Our Watchfulneſs muſt be exercis'd in adding Grace to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41902:86"/> Grace; for otherwiſe, as the Apoſtle ſaith, we ſhall be <hi>blind,</hi> and not ſee ſo <hi>afar off,</hi> as to behold the <hi>King in his beauty,</hi> and the <hi>Land that is very far off,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 9, &amp;c. with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33. 17. Thus an abundant and rich Entrance <hi>ſhall be miniſtred unto us, into the Everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> We ſhall be <hi>ready,</hi> and not <hi>go to buy,</hi> and <hi>find the Door ſhut.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. We <hi>Watch</hi> by continual Meditation upon being <hi>diſſolved, and being with Chriſt,</hi> and upon <hi>the Glory of his Coming;</hi> We need not be written to <hi>of the Times and Seaſons, for we our ſelves ſhall know, that the Day of God ſo cometh as a Thief in the night; and as ſudden deſtruction cometh on them, that ſay Peace, Peace;</hi> but they that <hi>watch</hi> thus, and are <hi>ſober, are not in darkneſs,</hi> and in the <hi>night;</hi> but are <hi>of the Day,</hi> and <hi>not aſleep,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. We muſt Watch againſt the Sin of the very Age and Day wherein we live; when we live in a prophane Age, take heed of that; when you live in a formal, hypocritical time, take heed of <hi>having a Name to live, and being dead;</hi> for Chriſt <hi>comes on ſuch as a Thief,</hi> at unawares. They ſhall <hi>not know,</hi> at <hi>what time he will come upon them, Rev.</hi> 3. 3. If a Senſual, Luxurious, World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Age; Take heed of being <hi>overcharged with thoſe evils, and the Cares of this Life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. Let us poſſeſs our ſelves with the moſt clear and diſtinct Apprehenſions of the <hi>Appearances of the Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> as the Kingdom of the Reſurrection, and of the Appearances of Saints in Bodies of Light and Glory, <hi>Rev. 16. 15. Behold I come as a Thief, Bleſſed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his Garments,</hi> that is, that looketh to the <hi>preſenting his Body now, as a ſacrifice, a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and acceptable ſacrifice well pleaſing to God in Christ,</hi> Rom. 12. Thus we ſhall appear in Bodies of <hi>Glory,</hi> and not of <hi>Contempt;</hi> in the <hi>Redemption of our Bodies,</hi> and Men cannot <hi>ſee our ſhame</hi> when Chriſt <hi>cometh, and all his Saints with him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Head</hi> 2. I come therefore to the <hi>Second Head,</hi> to lay down the Arguments of Perſwaſion, that we may be moved to this <hi>watch.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argument 1. The Time of</hi> Watch <hi>is only the Time of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Life:</hi> Whatever we would do for the <hi>After State,</hi> it is to be done in the <hi>Preſent State,</hi> in the Time of the <hi>preſent Life; There is no Counſel nor Device in the Grave whither we are going;</hi> and therefore, whatever <hi>Our Hands find to do,</hi> for that After-State, let us do it now; For in dying, Spirits going out of Bodies enter into their Determinative State; They enter in the State they were
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41902:86"/> in here; They carry out the <hi>Oil,</hi> they have, whether only in the <hi>Lamp</hi> of their Profeſſion, or in the <hi>Veſſel,</hi> the Heart united to Chriſt the Fountain; And ſo they muſt abide, ſo they muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, when the <hi>Bridegroom cometh;</hi> This is the holy and wiſe Decree of God, concerning the Human Spirit, and who dare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll it.</p>
                     <p>From hence then it neceſſarily follows, That this <hi>Watch</hi> is to be maintained in this Preſent State; and that, it can be only here; and that therefore, it is only in order to and with relation to the <hi>Coming of the Bridegroom,</hi> but not with relation to the Time of his <hi>Coming;</hi> for then the Doctrine of <hi>Watching</hi> had not been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Perſons living ſo many Ages before it; but becauſe every perſon ſucceſſively living ſince the Time our Lord ſpake theſe words, is in the Time of his Life to exerciſe this <hi>Watch;</hi> that is, to ſee he hath the <hi>Oil</hi> in his <hi>Veſſel,</hi> and not in his <hi>Lamp</hi> only, that he may <hi>ſtand before the Son of Man at his Coming;</hi> Therefore it is a <hi>Doctrine</hi> neceſſary to every Age, as well thoſe furtheſt off, as thoſe neareſt to his <hi>Coming;</hi> becauſe every one hath but a Life-Time to <hi>Watch</hi> in; and he is much more to be wrought upon by the ſence of the ſhortneſs and incertainty of his own Life, than by the nearneſs of the <hi>Bridegrooms Coming,</hi> and the incertainty of the time of that, as we plainly ſee by every Days Experience: And this is much the more unconteſtable, by obſerving the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s earneſtneſs, againſt the Chriſtians of thoſe Times, thinking <hi>the Day of Chriſt</hi> was then <hi>at hand,</hi> which he ſolemnly affirms, could not be, till an <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> of 1260 Days of Years ſhould have come in (and that not immediately neither) and have run out; Yea, our very Lord himſelf, when <hi>They thought the Kingdom of God ſhould immediately have appeared,</hi> Luke 19. 11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> gives the Parable of <hi>a Nobleman going into a far Country, and returning;</hi> importing a diſtance of Time; all which had been a <hi>contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to <hi>watching,</hi> becauſe we <hi>know not the day nor hour;</hi> if the meaning had not been a making <hi>proviſion</hi> in the preſent Life for the <hi>Bridegrooms Coming,</hi> how many Ages after ſoever it ſhould be; and that elſe, it would <hi>come upon</hi> us at <hi>unawares,</hi> and on the ſudden, and find us <hi>unready, unprovided</hi> for it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argument</hi> 2. It further appears, That <hi>Watching</hi> is the making ſuch proviſion in this preſent Time for the <hi>Bridegrooms Coming,</hi> as will bear up to the Glory of that Time; becauſe in the ſame State wherein we lie down, we ſhall riſe at that day, whenever it
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41902:87"/> be, and openly appear therein in the face of Heaven and Earth.</p>
                     <p>The Judgment of Spirits, though it be before God and Chriſt, and Aangels, and Saints; yet Scripture ſpeaks of it as of a private Judgment; for the Day of the Appearance of Chriſt is ſpoken of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5. as the <hi>Revelation</hi> or uncovering that <hi>righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God;</hi> which as paſs'd upon <hi>Spirits returning to God that gave them,</hi> is as covered and ſecret; There is greateſt reaſon to be aſſured, That when Spirits of Saints come into the hand of Chriſt, there is <hi>joy in Heaven;</hi> for if there be joy at their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion in the <hi>preſence of the Angels of God,</hi> and ſo of Saints, there is much more ſo in the coming of Spirits to Glory; but this Joy, and the Shouts of it are not heard down on Earth; But at that Appearance of Chriſt, they are preſented with <hi>exceeding joy</hi> before Heaven and Earth; And ſo are All, not in Chriſt, with <hi>contempt</hi> and <hi>diſhonour:</hi> And this is the great Myſtery and Wonder of the <hi>Oeconomy,</hi> the Order of that Day; That perſons riſe in the very ſame State, wherein they lie down; God will have it ſo, for the clearneſs of his Judgment; though perſons die <hi>in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a Bed,</hi> as the Prophets expreſſion is, yet they ſhall open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear in the ſame circumſtances they died; God will have every ones Judgment, as in all orderly Governments, to be <hi>ſub Dio,,</hi> openly in the Face of Heaven and Earth; they ſhall all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as in the Fact <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>; Thus <hi>he will be glorified in his Saints,</hi> and <hi>admired in all them that believe, in that day;</hi> and <hi>juſtified</hi> in the Condemnation of all, whom he condemns. If God ſhould diſpoſe of ſome to Hell, and ſome to Heaven; and that there were no publick account of the matter, we might think, they were ſo diſpoſed of by God, as by an Arbitrary Power, and in ſecret, and ſo his Juſtice called in Queſtion: But when Spirits, that have been ſo diſpoſed of in private, both Spirits ſo publickly, and Bodies are called for together, and the Judgment affirmed; This is clear and open proceeding; and therefore a <hi>Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and of <hi>Reſurrection</hi> is ſo often ſpoken of: All ſhall be brought Face to Face; and we ſhall not only know one another, who have converſed together, but even of all Ages; <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob; Cain</hi> and <hi>Eſau, Saul, Achitophel</hi> and <hi>Judas;</hi> All ſhall be known, and we ſhall know what becomes of every one to Eternity; Death here, and Spirits entring into their everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting ſtate is not All; of which we may ſay, <hi>Who knows the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a Saint, of a wiſe Virgin,</hi> that goes upward; of a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41902:87"/> man, of a <hi>fooliſh Virgin</hi> that goes downward: But at that Day ſhall be known; All the Good Men, we have read of in Scripture, or in true Accounts of Hiſtory; And the Evil Men, and Hypocrites; Each Company, and Perſon, apart, and apart; God and Chriſt will paſs upon all openly, and in Publick.</p>
                     <p>And that which I would further urge, every one ſhall Riſe in the very Fact, the <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, in which they lay down, <hi>Belſhazzars</hi> in their way, <hi>Diveſes</hi> in their way, the Worldlings in their way; and the <hi>Fooliſh Virgins</hi> in their way, <hi>Crying, Lord, Lord,</hi> without Truth, and Power, as here; The great Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, Enemies of the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> in their way: To that purpoſe, they are deſcrib'd, as <hi>having laid their Weapons of War</hi> under <hi>their Heads, with their Iniquities upon their Bones,</hi> Ezek. 32. 17. and ſo they'll come to the <hi>Battel of Armageddon;</hi> The Iniquity, and the <hi>Bones,</hi> the Perſons, and <hi>Weapons of War</hi> will appear together, in that Day of the <hi>Revelation of the Righteous Judgment of God;</hi> as even then in actual War againſt the <hi>Lamb</hi> and his Saints. This is the Great, and ſtupendious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the <hi>Day of Judgment,</hi> of <hi>that Day,</hi> and <hi>Hour,</hi> of which in this Senſe eſpecially; and not as relating to Time; <hi>no one knows, no Angels,</hi> no not the <hi>Son,</hi> as Man; <hi>The Father only,</hi> the Eternal Beeing alone had Wiſdom to find out, Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Dominion, and Power, thus to execute.</p>
                     <p>It is therefore the great Point of <hi>watchfulneſs,</hi> to Live ſo, and ſo to Dye, as we would deſire to Riſe, and to Appear; we are not therefore on this Account ſo <hi>ſenſible,</hi> as we ought to be, how great a thing it is to Dye: We know, it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Thing <hi>appointed to all, once to Dye,</hi> and it's no diſgrace <hi>to dye the common Death of Men;</hi> becauſe <hi>all Dye;</hi> and ſome <hi>Senſe</hi> Men have of a Private Judgment, at that Time; but to conſider; thus we muſt Riſe, and Appear, as we Dye, Oh how ſhould it oblige us to <hi>Watch,</hi> to get into Jeſus Chriſt, to be <hi>found in him; juſtified by his Blood, ſanctified by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> full of Faith, Repentance, every Grace; to <hi>Dye,</hi> and <hi>Sleep in,</hi> and <hi>by Jeſus,</hi> that we may ſo Riſe, and Appear, <hi>Come with him:</hi> This is indeed the <hi>knowing</hi> ſo, as that, <hi>that Day</hi> ſhould not <hi>take</hi> us at <hi>unawares,</hi> and <hi>unready,</hi> as having not <hi>Oyl</hi> in the <hi>Veſſel:</hi> For if you get it not now, you can never get it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg. 4. All things at the</hi> Coming of the Bridegroom <hi>ſhall be
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41902:88"/> carried by ſuch a Rapid Motion, That no Tongue can expreſs the ſwiftneſs of it; That Saints and wicked men are immediately,</hi> Body <hi>and</hi> Spirit, <hi>in that condition, as to Eſſential Happineſs, or Miſery, wherein they ſhall be for ever; and with all the circumſtances, in which they lived and died; it is incredible upon any account, but of Divine Power.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are many <hi>Motions</hi> ſo ſwift, that a Man cannot know them, The greateſt <hi>Naturaliſt</hi> cannot give an exact account of: The great ſpeed of a Bullet in the Air is wonderfully ſwift; the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sun, meaſur'd either by Hours, Quarters, Minutes or Seconds; No one can conceive, what way the Sun makes in the Heavens in each of them, when he <hi>comes as a Bridegroom out of his Chamber,</hi> and <hi>rejoiceth as a ſtrong man to run a Race;</hi> and yet, it is nothing in compare with this illuſtrious <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> of which that is but a dark ſhadow; I would mention ſome Scriptures giving account of this ſwiftneſs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 27. The Deſtruction of Wicked Men is compared to a <hi>Whirlwind,</hi> a Motion ſo ſudden, none can expreſs: <hi>Malach. 3. 5. I will be a ſwift Witneſs,</hi> A Witneſs ought to be conſiderate, and a Judge patient in hearing; and it is their commendation; But it is the Glory of God, who is both <hi>Witneſs</hi> and <hi>Judge,</hi> all in one, that he is both moſt juſt, and yet moſt ſwift; <hi>I'll do all</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>in a very little moment of time;</hi> again, you know of what a ſwift Motion, the <hi>Lightning</hi> is, from one <hi>End</hi> of Heaven to the <hi>other end of Heaven</hi> in a Moment. The Motion of the Sun is exceeding <hi>ſwift,</hi> and yet the Motion of <hi>Lightning,</hi> even as of Light from the Sun, is much ſwifter; now of ſuch a ſwift Motion ſhall all the Carriage of the <hi>Day of the Son of Man</hi> be; or the <hi>Son of Man</hi> in his day, ſhall move as <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Luke</hi> 17. 24. What a little time is an <hi>Atom</hi> of Time; it is the ſmalleſt, moſt undividible for littleneſs, we can conceive; Now, ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 1, 2. In an Atom or Moment of Time, in the Twinkling of an Eye, the Dead ſhall be raiſed incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible; and we the living Saints ſhall be changed:</hi> None can expreſs or think this ſwiftneſs.</p>
                     <p>Now from all this, it follows beyond all denial; That if a man could give all the World, he cannot change himſelf on ſuch a ſudden; How can a Man change himſelf in the <hi>Twinkling of an Eye?</hi> and that therefore there is no poſſibility, that any ſhould make a Change then: If we have <hi>run</hi> therefore with the <hi>Footmen,</hi> and <hi>they have wearied us, how ſhall we run with the Horſemen?</hi> and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41902:88"/> if while we were in a Land of Peace, we could not draw nigh, <hi>what ſhall we do in the ſwelling of</hi> Jordan? <hi>ſurely in the Floods of theſe great Waters, we cannot draw nigh to God;</hi> and therefore, our <hi>watch,</hi> is to be with relation to the <hi>Coming of the Bridegroom;</hi> perfected while we are here, before we are gone out of the Body; for in our Riſing again, all will be ſo ſudden, there will be nothing to be done.</p>
                     <p>And this is a plain and downright ſence of <hi>not knowing at what hour our Lord cometh,</hi> and does no ways concern a <hi>Scripture Line of Time</hi> to his <hi>Coming;</hi> For thus underſtanding, the <hi>Day of the Son of Man,</hi> the <hi>Bridegrooms Coming,</hi> will not be more ſudden, on thoſe who ſhall be alive at it, than on thoſe who lived an Hundred Years ago, or any time ſince, or at this very Preaching of Chriſt, or indeed never ſo long before it; for all ſhall be raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to feel the ſuddenneſs of it, as <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>Pſal. 58. 9. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Pots can feel the Thorns, he ſhall take them away living, and in his Wrath;</hi> All ſhall be done ſo ſuddenly and in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And on the other ſide, take any of the Saints of God, at what time ſoever they lived, nearer or further off from that Day; that <hi>Day</hi> or <hi>Coming of the Bridegroom</hi> is no more ſudden to thoſe that live neareſt, than to thoſe who live furtheſt off; becauſe they are ready with <hi>Oil in their Veſſels;</hi> if this were not ſo, there had been no force of our Lord's commanding thoſe, to whom he ſpake, to <hi>Watch:</hi> For in his Diſcourſes, he tells them of <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> being <hi>led Captive of all Nations, till the Time of the Gentiles ſhould be fulfilled;</hi> and that very <hi>Captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was Forty Years about, from the Preaching of Chriſt; and before that came, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures, <hi>That Day could not come, except the Apoſtacy came firſt,</hi> as was before ſaid; The ſum therefore is, The truth of Grace ſtanding in Union to Chriſt by his Spirit, and Holineſs flowing from thence, is the true <hi>watching,</hi> and ſuch a <hi>knowing,</hi> as to be <hi>ready,</hi> and that <hi>Day</hi> not to <hi>come</hi> as a <hi>ſnare,</hi> and at <hi>unawares;</hi> Thus Chriſt <hi>keeps his from the hour of Temptation that ſhall come upon all the Word, to try them that dwell upon the Earsh, Rev.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Application.</hi> The General <hi>Application</hi> of ſo great a Point, that I ſhall conclude the Diſcourſe of it with is, <hi>That we would ſearch the Scriptures, as thoſe noble</hi> Bereans <hi>did, whether thoſe things are ſo or not?</hi> I would deſire no other Judge but the Scripture, that excellent Book, that I hope, we have all in ſo great eſteem; now by this it will appear, That I have not ſpoken theſe things of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41902:89"/> my ſelf, and that I have not ſpoken the <hi>half</hi> of the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of that bleſſed Word therein.</p>
                     <p>And ſeeing we have ſo great reaſon to hope, the Kingdom of Chriſt is ſo near, how earneſt ſhould we be for the advantage of the Time; How ſhould we deſire to ſee one, that is in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture way of ſpeaking, the <hi>firſt of the Days of the Son of Man:</hi> Oh! What a change would ſuch a <hi>one Day</hi> make in the World, If we ſay, Why hath not God vouchſafed the World ſo great an Advantage ſooner? The Anſwer is, <hi>Times,</hi> in this regard, <hi>The Father hath ſet or conſtituted in his own power;</hi> He diſtributes them as he pleaſes, Why did not our Lord Jeſus appear ſooner in the World? He came in the <hi>End of the World,</hi> and in <hi>theſe laſt days God hath ſpoken to us by his Son.</hi> And ſaith our Lord to his Diſciples, <hi>Many Prophets and Righteous Men have deſired to ſee the things you ſee, and have not ſeen them, and to hear the things you hear, and have not heard them.</hi> But when that Time comes, how will the <hi>Bridegrooms</hi> near approach change the World; Converts will come in as the Drops of Dew from the <hi>Womb</hi> of the <hi>Morning,</hi> which is ſtiled, <hi>The Dew of Chriſts youth; Then ſhall the eyes of the blind ſee out of obſcurity; the eyes of the blind ſhall be opened,</hi> and <hi>the ears of the deaf ſhall be unſtopped,</hi> and the <hi>Tongue of the ſtammerers ſhall ſpeak plainly,</hi> Iſa. 29. 18. &amp; 32. 3, 4. <hi>The Lame ſhall leap as an Hart, and the Tongue of the dumb ſhall ſing; and there ſhall be a way, it ſhall be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the way of holineſs, the unclean ſhall not paſs over it:</hi> It ſhall be ſo plain and eaſie, that <hi>wayfaring Men though fools, ſhall not err therein:</hi> it ſhall be ſo ſecure, <hi>That no Lion,</hi> nor <hi>ravenous Beaſt ſhall be there,</hi> it ſhall be for thoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>ſervants of Chriſt.</hi> Oh! how ſhall all this flowing from the <hi>powring out of the Spirit</hi> from on high, awaken to make proviſion of <hi>Oil in the Veſſel,</hi> to look to the truth of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Chriſt, and ſecure againſt <hi>Fooliſh Virginity,</hi> For the <hi>Wilderneſs ſhall become a fruitful field.</hi> But the more particular Application, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve for the following Diſcourſe, as concluſive of the whole.</p>

                     <p>I Shall at this Time, by the aſſiſtance of God, fully conclude the long Diſcourſe that I have had upon this Great <hi>Parable,</hi> by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41902:89"/> all that hath been ſpoken in practical Applications of it; wherein I cannot but remember what I have ſo often mentioned, of our Lord's ſaying, <hi>I will open my mouth in Parables,</hi> and <hi>utter things that have been kept ſecret from the foundation of the World.</hi> By Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, it is applied to himſelf.</p>
                     <p>And ſurely, this is an exceeding great <hi>Parable,</hi> and it is eſpecially fitted to every one that draws near to God, and to Chriſt, in the profeſſion of the Goſpel. For ſo (as I have told you) it is very evident, That this Name of <hi>Virgins,</hi> neceſſarily implies, the moſt Excellent State of Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, that is not tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and thoroughly, and univerſally ſound; for were it not, that the word <hi>Fooliſh,</hi> comes in, and like a <hi>dead Fly</hi> (as I told you) makes the whole <hi>Box of oyntment, to ſend forth a ſtinking ſavour;</hi> the very name of <hi>Virginity,</hi> every where in Scripture, is on purpoſe to ſet forth the reality of Grace, and of a State in Chriſt. It is ſaid there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>The Virgins ſhall be brought unto thee in Rayment of Needle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, Pſal.</hi> 45. It is a Great State: So <hi>I have eſpouſed you, as a chaſte Virgin to Chriſt.</hi> It is ſaid of the 144000 on Mount <hi>Sion</hi> with the Lamb; <hi>They</hi> have not <hi>defiled themſelves with Women, for they are Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, Rev.</hi> 14. 4. So that, if Chriſt did not diminiſh and abate this of Virgins with Folly, it could not but import the perfect and beſt ſtate of Chriſtianity. And therefore, the more we look upon our ſelves as Chriſtians, and Chriſtians of the right ſtamp; the more we muſt look, that we be not <hi>Fooliſh Virgins;</hi> that our <hi>Virginity</hi> be not turned into <hi>folly.</hi> As it is ſaid of <hi>Achitophel, God turned the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of</hi> Achitophel <hi>into fooliſhneſs,</hi> the very <hi>Virginity</hi> of his <hi>Counſel</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> that was eſteemed as an <hi>Oracle,</hi> and never diſgrac'd till that time. So when the <hi>Virginity</hi> of the Soul is turned into <hi>fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs;</hi> It is a very great Judgment, and the very expreſſion of it, ought to awaken and rouze all our Spirits; Not to diſcourage the thoughts of the ſincere ſervants of Chriſt, and to make them ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful, whom God would have to be made glad, and to rejoice; But that there may be a holy <hi>Jealouſie</hi> in every one over our ſelves, and that we may not take Counterfeit for Gold indeed, and for Pearl indeed. I have therefore cloſed with this Application our Saviour hath made of his whole Diſcourſe: <hi>Watch therefore, for ye know nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the day, nor the hour wherein the Son of Man cometh.</hi> That is, as if Chriſt ſhould ſay, as I told you there will be nothing done at that time; you can make no advantage, you cannot command that <hi>day</hi> and that <hi>hour;</hi> there's nothing at all to be done; All ſhall be
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41902:90"/> in ſo ſpeedy a Motion, that there will be nothing to be done, by way of Amendment, or Reparation of the Errors, that we have committed. Now therefore, as I propoſed to you the laſt day ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral great particulars; ſo I ſhall purſue them at this time in a way of fuller and more cloſe Application.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Take notice of that which is eſpecially meant by <hi>watching:</hi> It muſt be that very thing, wherein the <hi>fooliſh Virgins</hi> fell ſhort; for though the <hi>wiſe,</hi> as well as the <hi>fooliſh</hi> (in the ſence I have given to you) <hi>ſlumbred and ſlept;</hi> yet for all that, the <hi>fooliſh Virgins</hi> only did not <hi>watch.</hi> They are they, that our Saviour grounds the Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon, <hi>Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour, wherein the Son of Man cometh.</hi> The <hi>wiſe Virgins</hi> did watch in the main Point, becauſe they looked to it, that all was done, that was neceſſary to be done, to meet Jeſus Chriſt at his coming, and to go in with him to the Wedding. And therefore, The Firſt particular, wherein we are to exerciſe this <hi>Watch,</hi> is to look, That we have the Divine and Spiritual Life in us. For no Man hath <hi>watched,</hi> that hath not looked well to this: That he is (as our Saviour expreſſes it) <hi>paſſed from death to life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If any of us go out of the World (as I told you) In this very life, every thing is to be looked unto: For, though the Day of Judgment, and the Coming of Chriſt, be a different thing, in many reguards from dying; yet notwithſtanding, whatever we would do, for that Day of the Coming of Chriſt, we muſt do it now, while we are here in the World; All is ſealed for Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Eternity at Death: <hi>There's no purpoſe nor counſel in the Grave</hi> (concerning this point) <hi>whither we are going.</hi> When any riſe from the dead, our Saviour makes it very apparent; <hi>John</hi> 5. They riſe, either to Life, or Condemnation; There's no ariſing ſo, as with any poſſibility of <hi>paſſing from death to life</hi> at that time, <hi>v. 28. Marvel not at this,</hi> (At what? it is plain what, <hi>viz.</hi> at the mighty quickning Voice of Chriſt now, for of that Chriſt had ſpoken juſt before:) <hi>for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the Graves ſhall hear his voice, and ſhall come forth, they that have done good, unto the reſurrection of life, and they that have done evil, unto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of damnation.</hi> You ſee here, all the whole World of Mankind, at that day of the Coming of Chriſt, they either riſe to the Reſurrection of Life, or to the Reſurrection of Damnation, nothing is then to be done more. This is a moſt evident and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Truth: And, as I have made out to you; Spirits com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41902:90"/> in to Bodies, come either full of the notices of Eternal life, or full of the Notices of Eternal Death; They carry all the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters upon them: They riſe, either <hi>to Honour, or to Everlaſting ſhame and contempt.</hi> And therefore, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, Ephe. 5. <hi>Awake, thou that Sleepeſt, and ſtand up from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee life, ver.</hi> 14. We muſt look well to this, That we <hi>hear the Voice of the Son of God</hi> now, <hi>and live: The time is coming, and now is, the Dead ſhall hear the Voice of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall live:</hi> Now is the quickning time, according to it Men come forth. The time is begun now, (ſaith he) and it ſhall go on to the very coming of the <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> that they <hi>that hear the Voice of the Son of God ſhall live,</hi> ver. 25. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, he that heareth my word, and believeth on him that ſent me, hath everlaſting life, and ſhall not come into Condemnation, but is paſſed from death unto life.</hi> We muſt look whether we have ſhot that great <hi>Gulf,</hi> of paſſing <hi>from death to life;</hi> for, this is a <hi>Gulf</hi> to be paſſed now, which in that future ſtate cannot be paſſed: As you know in that 16th of <hi>Luke 24. There's a great Gulph fixed between us and you; ſo that they which would paſs from you to us cannot, neither doth any paſs from us to you,</hi> that are in thoſe Regions of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: So I ſay, the <hi>Gulf</hi> is now to be paſs'd; There is a Paſs now, but there ſhall be none in that State; <hi>they are paſt from death to life.</hi> It is as if our Saviour ſhould ſay, They have ſhot the <hi>Gulf:</hi> And therefore let us conſider, whether God hath changed us (as it were) from Weſt to Eaſt? Whether he hath turned us to the Riſing of the Sun of Righteouſneſs with Healing in his Wings? Whether he hath turned our thoughts to Eternity, and from the preſent World, and all the Impurities of it? Whether the Face of our Spirits are to the Kingdom of God, or not? Let us look ſeriouſly to all thoſe Scriptures, that teach us concerning the truth of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; concerning the truth of Faith; concerning the truth of Repentance: It is our duty, undoubtedly, to <hi>trim our Lamps,</hi> in this reguard, now; and to ſearch and ranſack every thing in our own ſouls; that we may be aſſured of the truth of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and that our hearts are ſo turned to God, that they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be turned back again: That we turn our hearts back ſo to Chriſt, That we ſay, <hi>Whither ſhould we go, thou haſt the words of eternal life.</hi> To find, that God hath ſo engag'd our hearts and thoughts to himſelf, that we can never more revolt from him: And though we fall, and there are many things that we complain
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41902:91"/> of, and bewail, and have reaſon to humble our ſelves; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, our ſouls have that Union to Chriſt, we are ſo knit to him, That the <hi>Golden Oil</hi> ſtill runs out upon us, from that great <hi>Son of Oil,</hi> that he empties out of himſelf, to us: That Holy, <hi>anointed one,</hi> that <hi>ſtands before the Lord of the whole Earth</hi> is continually ſupplying, and giving out to us, from himſelf.</p>
                     <p>2. The <hi>Second</hi> thing that I propoſed to you, by way of dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to this <hi>watching,</hi> is, That you would look to this, to be ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, inſtant in fervent Prayer, and to pray eſpecially, to this very Point; That you may be counted worthy to ſtand before Jeſus Chriſt at his coming. Our Prayers ought to be for the preſent ſtate of Grace, indeed, and for all the ſigns of it; but we are to have a continual ardency in Prayer, to <hi>ſtand before Chriſt:</hi> For, if you conſider, if the very Coming of Chriſt ſhould be now, if he ſhould now be coming and appearing, every one would be ready to run to their Prayers, to thoſe Prayers they have accuſtomed themſelves to; nay, thoſe that have uſed themſelves to a common and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal way of Prayer, would be ready to ſtretch out themſelves to a higher way; Wherefore, let us endeavour after this, <hi>to pray continually,</hi> (as if Chriſt were coming) That we may be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Guilt of Sin; That we may be delivered from all our corruptions; That we may be in <hi>Robes waſhed white in his bloud;</hi> That we may be in the <hi>Wedding Garment:</hi> That we may have every thing ſuited to the Glory of his Coming and Appearance: So you ſhall find our Saviour directs his Diſciples, upon this very account, <hi>Luke 21. Watch ye therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to eſcape all theſe things, that ſhall come to paſs, and to ſtand before the Son of Man, at his coming. Take heed that our hearts be not overcharged with ſurfeiting and drunkenneſs, and with the cares of this life:</hi> But that we are in a continual po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of expecting the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And in the 12th <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Luke 36, And ye your ſelves like unto Men that wait for their Lord, when he will come, becauſe of the Wedding, that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.</hi> We ſhould take great care of the ſtate of our hearts now, that we may at that very time, be found not ſo as <hi>Gluttons, Drunkards</hi> are, but <hi>Watching, Praying.</hi> But you know, There's no ſuch thing, as <hi>Gluttony</hi> and <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> in the Future State of Spirits; there's nothing of <hi>the cares of this life,</hi> in that future ſtate; but, they are the things that now oppreſs, and that now take away the hearts
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:41902:91"/> of Men. And <hi>this know</hi> ſaith he (<hi>ver. 39.) That if the good man of the houſe had known what hour the Thief would come; he would have watched, and not have Suffered his houſe to be broken through. Be ye therefore ready alſo; for the Son of Man cometh in an hour when ye think not.</hi> The <hi>Argument</hi> therefore Lies that we ſhould do now what we would do; For juſt ſo we ſhall Riſe and Appear: as hath been made out: There ought therefore to be a holy violence upon every ones preparation, by Earneſt Prayer and Supplication for that Day; we ought every one to pray, as if juſt, that very day was upon him; We ſhould pray with the ſame Earneſtneſs, as if that Day, were even now upon us. This therefore is that Great Rule that our Saviour gives us, in Relation to that Time, that we ſhould ſo pray now, That we ſhould not at that Day, be in the Confuſion, and in the Horrour of thoſe Things. Luke 21. 35. <hi>Watch ye and pray, that ye may be accounted worthy to eſcape thoſe things that ſhall come to paſs, and to ſtand before the Son of Man;</hi> You ſee here, that <hi>ye may ſtand before the Son of Man,</hi> there muſt be a <hi>watching to prayer;</hi> and a <hi>watching</hi> upon this very account. O! that we could be ſenſible of that Day, and ſtir up our ſupplications in that very point! So the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> For I would endeavour to argue the Scripture upon you, that the great Intention and Earneſtneſs of our Prayer, ſhould run to that very Point, of the Coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet. 4. 7. The end of all things is at hand, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore watch unto Prayer. Let us be continually watching unto Prayer,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this very account, becauſe <hi>the end of all things is at hand:</hi> If we conſidered that, it would engage and ſtir up our Prayers, <hi>Be ſober and watch unto Prayer,</hi> for our Prayers will meet us then, we ſhall riſe in them at that Day.</p>
                     <p>3. In the <hi>Third</hi> Place, Our Watchfulneſs ſhould ſtand in this, in a conſtant, living ſence of the Word of God (eſpecially in this great point) upon us: That we ſhould have a Meditation upon the Word of God. It is a very hard thing for us to entertain our thoughts in the Night, when we are awake; or when we are alone; it is a hard thing to know how to employ our Thoughts, and to engage them: And therefore, if we could take the Word of God, That would keep us in an awful ſence of God, and of eternal things. <hi>David</hi> often ſpeaks of his Meditation in the Word of God, Pſal. 119. <hi>I meditate in thy Word; I meditate in thy Statutes; it is my meditation all the day:</hi> And <hi>Pſal. 1. 1. Bleſſed is the man that walketh not in the counſel of the ungodly,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but his delight is in the Law of the Lord; and in that Law doth he meditate Day and Night.</hi> Saith <hi>David, I ſtir
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41902:92"/> up my ſelf, I awake in the night, that I might meditate in thy ſtatutes.</hi> If we could ſeriouſly bring into our thoughts the Meditations of the <hi>end of all things;</hi> but we are ſo concern'd for this little ſpot of Time; even for that next Moment that is before us, <hi>what we ſhall eat, and what we ſhall drink,</hi> and <hi>what we ſhall put on,</hi> and how this and that ſhall be maintained: If our hearts were but ſuitably and proportionably fixt upon that, What ſhall we do for our Eternal Condition? How ſhall we bear that Day? Would not any one ſet that Day before him, if he were really poſſeſt of it? If a Man were to Plead his Cauſe, and whole condition in this World: who of us could keep his Heart and Thoughts from oft running into't? Now, if we could keep our Meditations upon thoſe Scriptures that ſpeak of this Eternal Condition; I beſeech you, endeavour to get up your ſelves, and to aſpire to it, by the Grace of God; and that you would <hi>meditate on theſe things,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> teaches <hi>Timothy, Meditate on theſe things, that thy profiting may appear to all men;</hi> He ſpeaks indeed there, of the preparation for the work of Preaching of the Goſpel; But let us apply it, for we are every one concerned in this Great Point, to be Preachers to our ſelves: Certainly, if eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one be not a <hi>Preacher</hi> to himſelf, all other <hi>Preachers</hi> can do him no good at all: And the Excellent Truths that lie in the Word of God, can do no good, till a Man comes to <hi>Preach</hi> them to himſelf: The <hi>Book of Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> is in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of it, the Book of the <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoul:</hi> that Book of <hi>Solomon,</hi> which we call the Book of the <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> it was the Book of the <hi>Preacher,</hi> firſt to himſelf, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 1. 1. It is obſerved by Learned Men, the Word ſignifies, <hi>The Preaching Soul;</hi> Every one ſhould be a <hi>Preaching Soul</hi> to himſelf, and <hi>Preaching</hi> this Great Point, <hi>Of the Coming and Kingdom of Chriſt.</hi> And this would engage our <hi>Watch,</hi> this would be like the ſnuffing the Lamps of our dark Apprehenſions, and blowing up the Flame of our cold and benumm'd affections: It would make the Light more clear, and it would be like the blowing up the fire; it would enflame and warm us with the ſtrength and vigour of thoſe great apprehenſions, that pertain to the <hi>Coming of Chriſt.</hi> Indeed, it is very ſad, That the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of the World is ſo covered, and ſo darkned, and ſo eclipſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo chill'd, and even frozen, in theſe things; We can go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to no Company, nay, we our ſelves, though we are ſenſible of theſe Truths, we ſpeak them, and hear of them; yet we don't know how to converſe like the Servants of God, That we might be all Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to our ſelves, and one to another in them; It is earneſtly to be hoped, and prayed for, That a betterſtate of things may come on;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41902:92"/> and that the Spirit may be poured out abundantly; And, <hi>Would</hi> (as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid) <hi>all the Lords People were Prophets;</hi> I cannot reaſonably think, that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake of a thing that was impoſſible; But ſurely, there ſhall be a time, that every one of the Servants of God ſhall have ſomething to ſay, as <hi>Prophets of the Lord,</hi> one to another. And this is the time that is earneſtly to be expected, and to be Prayed for: I make no doubt, but the World ſhall have ſuch a Time of preparation in order to the Great and Glorious <hi>Coming of Chriſt, Acts</hi> 2. 17. Pray obſerve, God will pour out his Spirit, to this very end, to this very purpoſe, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>I will pour out my Syirit upon all fleſh, and your Sons and you Daughters ſhall Propheſie, and your young men ſhall ſee Viſions, and your old men ſhall dream Dreams.</hi> Every one ſhall have ſomething to offer to another, concerning God. <hi>And on my ſervants, and on my hand-maidens, I will pour out in thoſe days of my Spirit, and they ſhall Propheſie, And I will ſhew Wonders in Heaven above, and Signs in the Earth beneath,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And the Sun ſhall be turned into Darkneſs, and the Moon into Bloud, before that Great</hi> (pray, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that) before that Great <hi>and illustrious Day of the Lord come.</hi> He will come in the ſtill Voice of his <hi>Spirit poured out;</hi> and of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one being enabled, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, as a <hi>Prophet.</hi> For, would <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> (do you think) have ſaid, Would every Atome of Duſt upon the Earth could be a Star! (he would not have wiſh'd ſuch a thing) or, That all the Drops of Water in the Sea might be turned into Gold and Pearls! Theſe things would have been ſtrange in <hi>Moſes;</hi> becauſe they are things that never ſhall be: But now, That all the <hi>Lord's People</hi> ſhall be <hi>Prophets;</hi> That's a thing God will certainly do, and awaken the World with, before that <hi>Great and Illuſtrious Day of the Lord come.</hi> In the mean time, Let us endeavour to be <hi>Preaching-Souls</hi> unto our ſelves: This is a thing, I am ſure, that no one can have reaſon to be offended at; Let Men be never ſo ſevere, that none muſt <hi>Preach,</hi> but ſuch and ſuch, ſo Educated, and Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; yet, to be a <hi>Preaching-Soul</hi> to our ſelves, none can be ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized, or offended at that.</p>
                     <p>4. In the <hi>Fourth</hi> Place; Let us take heed and keep our ſelves from our Iniquity; that there may be no Sin that we ſhall be found in at the coming of Chriſt, that we give Indulgence to now, no courſe of known ſin, or of the neglect of any known Duty. Let us take care of this, that we do not allow our ſelves in any way of ſin, <hi>that we ſearch and try our ways continually,</hi> that we <hi>may turn unto God.</hi> Il'l give you two notable Scriptures to this very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; (though a great many more might be given) <hi>I was alſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41902:93"/> before him, and kept my ſelf from mine iniquity, Pſal.</hi> 18. 23. That's a very great Scripture, though I have already ſpake of it; that eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, that I would direct you to now, is in the 139th <hi>Pſalm 23. 24. Search me, O God, and know my heart; try me, and know my thoughts, and ſee if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</hi> You ſee here, It is a very Difficult, point. For, If a <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi> may be ſhut out for ever; what Reaſon have we to lay: our thoughts open before God? and to ſay unto him, <hi>Search me, O God; I know not how to Search my Self;</hi> I am ſo Dark, and Blind to my ſelf, in my own peculiar Iniquity, That I know it not. But do thou <hi>Search me, and know my heart, Try me,</hi> and <hi>know my thoughts, And ſee if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlaſting; Any wicked way in me,</hi> That is, The way of living in any Sin, or giving up my ſelf to any Luſt. Let us be mighty Cautious, very careful in This, to lay our ſelves before God; for, Indeed, If any one would ſay to me, Which way ſhall I help my ſelf? You ſay, <hi>That a Virgin may be a Fooliſh Virgin;</hi> You ſay, That Virginity is the Beſt State in the profeſſion of Chriſtianity; And yet There may be ſuch a Worm at the Root of it, as may wither it all; What then ſhall I do? Does not this Diſcourage in the way of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, If I may be ſo Miſtaken, and Deceived in it? Were not the <hi>Fooliſh Virgins</hi> as likely in their own Eyes, as the <hi>Wiſe?</hi> Therefore I ſay; No other way, but to lie at the Foot of Chriſt, and of the Spirit of Chriſt, and Earneſtly to pray, <hi>Search me O God, and know my heart, Try me, and know my thoughts,</hi> and my Secret Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; <hi>and ſee if there be any any Secret wickedneſs in me, and lead me in the way Everlaſting.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If we did continually This, and if our hearts were fully Set upon it, certainly, <hi>God would bring forth our Righteouſneſs as the Light, and our Judgment as the Noon-Day;</hi> Surely, God will Diſcover This, if we are Sincere. It is the beſt counſel, that can be given, and the beſt Example, that can be laid before us. And ſo, That of our Saviour I look upon as the peculiar duty in order to our waiting for <hi>the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> I ſay, I look upon it to be the very peculiar Duty; Our Lord ſaith, concerning this, <hi>Let your Loins be girded about, and your Lights burning, Luke</hi> 12. 35. And ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> expounds this Scripture more fully to us; and he directs it to this very Point, of <hi>Looking to the Kingdom of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, 1 Pet. 1. 13. Wherefore gird up the Loins of your Mind, be ſober, and hope to the end, for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Beſides all the Grace of the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41902:93"/> Goſpel at the preſent; there is the Crowning-Grace, There is the <hi>Triumphing-Grace</hi> that is to be brought to us at the <hi>appearing of Chriſt. Gird up the loins of your mind; be ſober and hope to the end, for that ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> You know, the <hi>loins,</hi> they are taken for thoſe parts of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature, wherein is the Seat of Senſuality and Corruption moſt of all; the Bodily-Luſt that men are affected with; And as the <hi>loins</hi> are girded, a Man is the more expedite, and ready for Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; So, when all that ſuperfluity of the Fleſh, and impure, ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al affection is <hi>girt up,</hi> and <hi>we hope perfectly for the Grace that is to be brought to us at the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Let us earneſtly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pray, <hi>Keep back thy Servant from preſumptuous ſins, that they may not have dominion over me. Then ſhall we lift up our face, clear as the Morning, and we ſhall lift up our head without ſpot,</hi> as <hi>Job.</hi> If Pride, if Luſt, if any inclination to the love of this World, to ſenſual Pleaſures and Delight, if any of this we find to be our ſin, any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Luſt; or Sin, whatever it is, Let us <hi>gird up the loins of our minds,</hi> wherein we find any extravagant and impetuous Motion to evil prevail upon us.</p>
                     <p>5. In the <hi>Fifth</hi> Place, Let this be our great care, to meditate much upon Death, Judgment and Eternity: Let thoſe common and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Notions prevail upon us: For my part, I have always, and deſire always to Declare, That I do not bind up any one to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular apprehenſions of my own, in theſe things, although I do fully believe ſuch an appearance of the <hi>Glory and Kingdom of Chriſt:</hi> Yet I ſay to every one, Let thoſe general and agreed Notions and Principles, be ſtrong upon your hearts: And the leſs you can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, and encline to believe ſuch an <hi>Appearance and Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> be the more Intent upon thoſe Four Laſt Things, as they are generally called: that is, <hi>Death, Judgment, Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell.</hi> Let thoſe General and acknowledged, and impreſſed Points, be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways upon your Minds. O! What kind of perſons ſhould we be, if we did but grow up to the acknowledged Points of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>Death, Judgment, Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell.</hi> Let us always take theſe into conſideration, and there is no Chriſtian but owns them: even <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves, thoſe of them that have been more Devout than others, have written very excellently and very notably upon theſe things; theſe Principles that run ſo mightily into all the ſence of Chriſtianity: God forbid, that any thing ſhould be ſaid to take off the plain Conſideration, and the ſtrong Apprehenſion, and the cloſe Meditation, and the mighty influence of thoſe Four Things from us. For who can enough ſpeak of them, or conſider them?
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41902:94"/> Take them in the plaineſt ſence that you can; And Oh that God would give you to feel, even every one of us, to feel the full work of them upon our hearts; that they may have, every one their perfect work upon our hearts: That (as I may allude) the Chariots of our Souls may be always moving upon theſe Four Wheels, and that our Chariots may never ſtand ſtill, but lift us up continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally above the Earth. It is my earneſt Prayer for every one of us (ſpeaking and hearing) That our Souls may be as the <hi>Chariots of Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadab;</hi> carried upon theſe Four Wheels of <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Judgment, Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell.</hi> And indeed, though I look upon it as a great Scripture-Truth, and which hath ſo great Evidence, as cannot be contradicted; yet I am far from preſſing any one to take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Conſideration; I mean, thoſe Apprehenſions concerning ſuch a Kingdom of Chriſt; So that they ſhould take off any thing from the ſerious Meditation of <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Judgment, Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell.</hi> And I would deſire only thoſe perſons to take them into Conſideration, that find they are more enlivened, and more enlarged, and more enflamed by the ſtrong Conſideration of the Great Things, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath ſpoken, and that are in a viſible and apparent way, to bring forth the <hi>Glory of the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And therefore, I hope, there is nothing that can be juſtly Taxed, in endeavouring to ſeek further into the Doctrines of Chriſtianity, beyond thoſe that are but the <hi>Beginning Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt:</hi> I would exhort every ſerious Chriſtian, to make theſe it his continual Meditation, and that nothing may take off the edge of his Spirit in theſe things. Say now, Am I not to die? And muſt I not come to Judgment? Is it not ſaid, <hi>It is appointed to all men once to die, and after this the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> Am I not immediately to come into a Judgment, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of my Eternal Condition? And am I not to ſtand before Chriſt in Judgment? Don't we all own that? And is there not a Heaven, and an Eternity of Happineſs? And is there not on the other hand, a black and dark Eternity, even utter darkneſs, and for ever? O that God would enable us to carry this all in our Minds! the Eternity of Happineſs, and the Eternity of Miſery. You know, great Princes are Pictured with great Globes in their hands, but Jeſus Chriſt hath thoſe Two great Globes, the <hi>Keys of Death,</hi> and <hi>Hell;</hi> and <hi>Eternal Life to give.</hi> Let theſe things be our plain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Meditation; Let us cut off every thing that we think is ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity; I am ſtill of the ſame Apprehenſion, that the Scripture hath declared, <hi>a viſible Kingdom and Glory</hi> that is near; Yet I beſeech you, that you would get theſe into your conſtant Apprehenſion.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41902:94"/> And, O that they might fall upon every one; Let nothing of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Opinion take off from theſe Great Things; Let us conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually take our Walk and Meditation into thoſe Regions beyond this World: Let us ſay, I am to go out of this World, and this State; and O, how Great muſt the Change be! That I muſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately enter into an Eternity of Happineſs, or an Eternity of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. Nothing will make the Doctrine of Chriſt ſo powerful, as to have a ſtrong Meditation of theſe Things: And then</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Seventh</hi> Place, Let us take heed of the ſins of the Time wherein we live (though, by all means, we are to take heed of the open Prophaneneſſes that are in the Wortd) but, I beſeech you, That we may all look to this, There are the peculiar Sins of thoſe that are called <hi>Virgins;</hi> There's ſomething peculiar to every Time; And therefore, as I have intimated to you, in that <hi>Rev. 3. 1. That Church of Sardis,</hi> I have for ſome time, look'd upon it to be the Pourtraiture of theſe very Times, and this very State we are upon: It is a Picture of the Church of Chriſt in that State we call <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant,</hi> and in that State we call, <hi>The Reformation:</hi> And therefore, obſerve how that is deſcribed, and let us look very diligently, that we don't fall into thoſe very ſins: <hi>And unto the Angel of the Church in Sardis, Write, Theſe things, ſaith he, that hath the Seven Spirits of God, and the Seven Stars: I know thy works, That thou haſt a Name that thou liveſt and art dead.</hi> O, Let us take heed of <hi>having a Name.</hi> To be a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> is a <hi>Name to live:</hi> To be of the <hi>Reformed Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> is a <hi>Name to live:</hi> Take heed, Is it not the General State of this very Age, of this very Time? <hi>We have a Name to live, and yet are dead:</hi> Among all the ſeveral Profeſſions and Churches of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, in the Reformed way, at this Day, ſurely it is a Sin that lies upon every one, <hi>They have a Name to live, and yet are dead:</hi> We find it one in another, but every one may find too much, that <hi>he hath a Name to live, but is dead.</hi> We may ſay to our ſelves, Is this like one that is come out of <hi>Popery,</hi> upon the account of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and upon the account of Truth and the Word of God? <hi>This is a Name to live;</hi> becauſe, ſay we, the things that <hi>Papiſts</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, and that they do, are not according to the Word of God: Why now, if it be a Name to live, to come out from among them, <hi>Take heed that we are not dead;</hi> If we have not the Power of Godlineſs, in the Profeſſion of the Reformed and <hi>Proteſtant Religion, It is but a Name to live; be watchful, and ſtrengthen the things that remain, and are ready to die.</hi> O! how truly may we ſay, That the Things in order to the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt, they are ready to die;</hi> every where,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41902:95"/> among all ſorts of Profeſſors! How ready is the Publick Way of Worſhip to die, for want of the Power of what they Profeſs? And, if you look upon the Congregated Profeſſors, with what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon do they complain, They are grown very Proud, very World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, very Vain, notwithſtanding all their Profeſſion. So here's a <hi>Name to live,</hi> in order to the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> but <hi>they are ready to die. Be watchful, and ſtrengthen the things which remain, that are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to die;</hi> Here's that <hi>Watch</hi> that Chriſt ſpeaks of: We ſhould take heed, and <hi>watch,</hi> that the things <hi>which remain,</hi> and <hi>are ready to die,</hi> might be quickned and have a new life: <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I have not found thy Works perfect before God:</hi> I have not found them <hi>filled</hi> out, and <hi>filled up:</hi> They are juſt like a Stalk of Wheat, that looks as if it were ſomething, and yet, like one of <hi>Pharaoh's lean Ears,</hi> if we come to ſearch, and enquire into it, and to Rub it (as we ſpeak) in our hands, we find it to be nothing; ſo indeed, we may ſadly complain, when we come to Rub Profeſſion, either in others, or in our ſelves; it is very thin, and lean, and lank: And therefore <hi>our works are not filled up before God.</hi> Now, what ſaith Chriſt? <hi>I will come upon thee as a Thief, and thou ſhalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.</hi> Let us therefore be very diligent in this thing, to look to have the Power of our Profeſſion, to have the Power of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion, to have the Power of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi> For indeed, It is a very ſad thing, that ſo many of us, as have a Zeal againſt <hi>Popery;</hi> a Zeal againſt the Corruption of that State; That yet we ſhould ſink ſo much below ſome of the Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioniſts among them: For undoubtedly, There are ſome among them, that ſeem to be under a greater Profeſſion than many <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> are. To hear a Man ſwear againſt their Religion profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to ſee a Man Drinking, and Carouſing, and ſaying, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the very uſual ways of Mens Diſcourſe: To drink (as it were) Healths to <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> Is not this an abominable Shame, and that ſpeaks our great diſhonour? And that may make even <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſcandalized at the looſe, and licentious way of thoſe that call themſelves <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> To hear Men Swear and Damn, and blaſpheme, and yet at the very ſame time, to profeſs a Zeal againſt <hi>Popery.</hi> Certainly, this we ought to take care of, That we are not carried away by the Name of a Wicked, Licentious, Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and Prophane <hi>Proteſtantiſm.</hi> And beyond this, we ſhould look; That that Pride, Vanity, Cruelty, Earthlineſs and Oppreſſion, and whatever the Sins are, that are among us, that we do not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, and diſguiſe them, under the Name of this; Why yet, for
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41902:95"/> all this, I am not a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> I am a <hi>Proteſtant;</hi> ſurely, God will Tear that Name out of the Mouths of ſuch <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> As he ſaith in <hi>Ezekiel, You ſow Pillows and Kerchiefs;</hi> that is, ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſing things upon <hi>their heads: And</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I'll tear theſe Kier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, Ezek.</hi> 13. So God will tear off from thoſe that have the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of <hi>Proteſtantiſm,</hi> but have nothing of the Power, Life and Zeal of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and their Open Teſtimony for the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that very Profeſſion from them.</p>
                     <p>In the laſt Place (that I may draw to a Concluſion.) Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all that I have ſaid to you, concerning the Thoughts of <hi>Death</hi> and of <hi>Judgment,</hi> and of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell;</hi> yet I would deſire, that we may have a ſence of the Glory, and of the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> that is to appear; and that you would look to have it in your hearts, to have the <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> in your hearts.</p>
                     <p>Let me propoſe a great Scripture to you upon this account: And after a ſhort Explanation of it, I'll conclude in a few Words, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 20. There was a great Queſtion put to Chriſt in this caſe; He was <hi>demanded of the Phariſees,</hi> when <hi>the Kingdom of God ſhould come, he anſwered them and ſaid, The Kingdom of God cometh not with Obſervation: Neither ſhall they ſay, lo here, or lo there: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Kingdom of God is within you.</hi> That's the <hi>Kingdom of God;</hi> For in ſome way, certainly, there's none of us but Profeſs it, elſe, why do we pray it ſhould come; When that, which is the Great Petition, the very Central-Petition of <hi>the Lord's Prayer,</hi> ſurely that's the very Key that turns all about? Now I ſay, if you would believe <hi>a Kingdom of God</hi> in any ſence: And that you will be ready to ſay, <hi>When ſhall that Kingdom come?</hi> Remember what Chriſt ſaith, it does not come by <hi>Obſervation;</hi> for Men ſhall not ſay, <hi>Lo, here,</hi> or <hi>lo, there;</hi> Though indeed, it ſhall be a Glorious Sight, a Glorious Shew, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>which in his Time he will ſhew.</hi> Yet for all that, you ſhan't ſay, <hi>Lo, here comes Chriſt, and here come ſuch and ſuch Saints:</hi> And here comes ſuch a Glory, and Heaven and Earth glowing in a flame. You ſhan't ſay, here or there, thus and thus it is, though you ſhall have reaſon to ſay ſo: yet (ſaith Chriſt) the main thing is, <hi>The Kingdom of God is within you.</hi> What will you be the better for that Kingdom of God, if it be not within you? You muſt bring it to that Day, <hi>The Kingdom of God comes not with Obſervation;</hi> it does not come with a ſhew without us, but our <hi>God will come, and all his Saints ſhall come with him.</hi> They ſhall come with <hi>Bodies of Glory,</hi> and <hi>Bodies of Light,</hi> Bodies full of Glory: it does not come with an outward
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41902:96"/> ſhew, but <hi>within us:</hi> Every one that hath not the <hi>Kingdom of God within him,</hi> at that Day, they will appear by that very thing, to be <hi>fooliſh Virgins;</hi> for, they muſt bring that <hi>Kingdom</hi> in the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Chriſt,</hi> with <hi>peace of Conſcience,</hi> through his Bloud, by Grace, and by Vertue of his Holy Spirit.</p>
                     <p>And now, I beſeech you, That you would ballance theſe two things continually one with another. You pray that the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> may <hi>come:</hi> The <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt comes,</hi> when his <hi>Day comes;</hi> when the <hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Appearance</hi> of Chriſt comes, 2 Tim. 4. 1. Now, Amos. 5. 18. Saith God, <hi>Wo unto you that deſire the Day of the Lord, to what end is it for you? the day of the Lord is darkneſs,</hi> and <hi>not light;</hi> As if a <hi>man did flee from a Lion,</hi> and <hi>a Bear met him;</hi> or <hi>went into the houſe,</hi> and <hi>leaned his hand on the wall, and a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent bit him.</hi> It is juſt ſuch a thing (ſaith the Prophet) as if a man in a ſtorm, ſhould go into a houſe, and take ſhelter there; and when he found the ſtorm ready to carry him away, he goes, and <hi>leans upon a Wall,</hi> and there a <hi>Serpent</hi> comes out of a <hi>Hole,</hi> and bites him to Death; Even ſo ſhall the <hi>Kingdom</hi> and <hi>Day of Chriſt be,</hi> It is in vain to ſay, <hi>Thy Kingdom come,</hi> If that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom be not within us: for, It comes not with <hi>Obſervation,</hi> but it is <hi>within us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>O Therefore! That we could be perſwaded to get out of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality of that <hi>Petition,</hi> and to look for that <hi>Kingdom within; Thy Kingdom come</hi> by my Enjoyment of ſuch a preſence of thy <hi>Kingdom</hi> within my own heart; That when it comes, I may come with it, and it may come along with me: for elſe, I ſay, it will be dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and not light. I make no doubt, there was a great many, that the Prophet ſpake uſually to them, of <hi>the Day of the Lord.</hi> You know, it is an uſual expreſſion in Scripture, <hi>The Day of the Lord:</hi> And, upon the often hearing of it, Men come to ſay, We would fain ſee it: And ſo, many are ready to ſay concerning that <hi>Kingdom;</hi> if it be ſuch a Glorious State and Thing, we would fain ſee it. Now remember, it comes not with <hi>obſervation,</hi> but you muſt have it <hi>within you;</hi> for, if you have it not <hi>within you,</hi> it is in vain for you; for, for what end do you deſire <hi>the day of the Lord?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To ſhut up this in a brief Recollection of all, In the <hi>Firſt</hi> Place, I deſire you ſeriouſly often to meditate upon this Parable, as I have in ſome weak manner, endeavoured to open it to you. And to remember alſo, That even my Chriſtianity (ſay to your ſelves) will
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41902:96"/> not do me any ſervice; I had as good have been a <hi>Heathen,</hi> as to the main purpoſe of my Eternal Condition, if I have not <hi>Oil in my Veſſel;</hi> if I have not truly a great repleniſhing of my Soul from the <hi>Great Son of Oil:</hi> And ſo, if you ſpeak of <hi>Proteſtantiſm;</hi> If you have not <hi>Oil in your Veſſel,</hi> it will be but a very empty thing, and do you no good, except you have <hi>Oil in your Veſſels;</hi> except you are united to Jeſus Chriſt; except you have the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God within you:</hi> And then</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Second</hi> Place: Another great Uſe (for I only draw out the main ſcope of the <hi>Parable,</hi> by way of Recollection, unto you, and ſo conclude) I ſay, ſeriouſly conſider, What ever you think to do for your ſouls, do it now, becauſe there is no Time after, <hi>Work while it is day, the night cometh when none can work.</hi> All the time that perſons have lain in the Grave (as we ſpeak) or that their Spirits have been in Happineſs, or in Miſery, they have not done the leaſt thing for their ſouls; they have not add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>one Cubit,</hi> nay, not one Hairs breadth to their <hi>Stature,</hi> they have not made one Hair (as our Lord ſpeaks <hi>Proverbially</hi>) either <hi>white or black,</hi> as to the State of their Spirits; And when Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits come to meet their Bodies, in the Day of the Reſurrection, every thing will be in ſuch a ſpeed, ſuch a World in higheſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That you cannot ſtay to change one ill Poſture, or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, ot Repreſentation of your ſouls. You muſt not ſtay, I would ſpeak according to the Language of the <hi>Parable, Can the Bride forget her Attire?</hi> If any of us have forgot our At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, we cannot mind any thing that is amiſs; We cannot faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en one Pin in that diſtreſs of our ſouls: We muſt be in the <hi>Wedding Garment</hi> perfectly attired, and arrayed: For what is done then (as I have often ſaid) is done in an <hi>Atome of Time,</hi> The <hi>dead ſhall be raiſed incorruptible,</hi> Wicked Men, and <hi>Fooliſh Virgins,</hi> ſhall be <hi>raiſed</hi> juſt as they <hi>die.</hi> And therefore, mind ſeriouſly to do for your ſouls, what you'd do, in this preſent ſtate. And then,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laſtly,</hi> As I have ſaid, I ſay again, That you would earneſtly pray for the Preparation of that Time, Pray earneſtly for the <hi>pouring out of the Spirit;</hi> Do you think it will not be better for you, when God <hi>ſhall pour out his Spirit upon all fleſh, when your Sons and your Daughters ſhall Propheſie;</hi> when <hi>your old men ſhall dream Dreams, and your young men ſhall ſee Viſions?</hi> When there ſhall be an univerſal <hi>Propheſie</hi> upon the People of God;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41902:97"/> as I have greateſt reaſon to hope, that the time is very near: Why ſhould we not earneſtly pray for it, and deſire it?</p>
                     <p>You think, there will be too much Clutter, and ado about Religion then; don't miſtake, Whatſoever is done, ſhall run ſo eaſie, and quiet then, with ſuch advantage, and the Great Cares and Diſadvantages of the World ſhall be taken off, and every thing ſhall be in a merciful order, that we may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for that Great and Notable <hi>Day of the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore, Let us earneſtly pray and wait, That a better ſtate, both of Chriſtianity in General, and the <hi>Reformation</hi> in particular, may come forth, That thoſe <hi>Thunders</hi> that have been <hi>Sealed</hi> ſince the <hi>Reformation,</hi> for almoſt an Hundred and Eighty Years, That their <hi>Mouths</hi> may be <hi>open,</hi> and their <hi>Voices</hi> may <hi>utter</hi> themſelves. That every thing may be that tends to increaſe and promote Holineſs, Purity and Spirituality, and Heavenli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for I am not ſpeaking, nor never did ſpeak to you of a Kingdom of Eating and Drinking, and putting on Glorious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel; but that there ſhall be an univerſal <hi>knowledge of God</hi> and Jeſus Chriſt. And that none but thoſe that are reſolved to be <hi>filthy</hi> ſhould remain <hi>filthy;</hi> and thoſe who give up themſelves in Holy ways, ſhould be Encouraged, and ſhould <hi>mount up with Eagles Wings, and Grow ſtronger and ſtronger.</hi> And therefore, that there is but the Hopes of theſe things, Let us Bleſs God Exceedingly. For many <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Wiſemen,</hi> and <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Righteous Men have deſired to ſee thoſe things, which you ſee and have not ſeen them, and to hear thoſe things, which you hear, and have not heard them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And yet for all that; If any of us are called to Die, who are Sincere, and faithfull; God will give us ſo much certainly of that Spirit of <hi>Propheſie,</hi> of Illumination; of Revelation, That ſhall carry us ſafe to Heaven; and ſhall Search and Try us ſo, That we <hi>ſhall be led out of any wicked way</hi> into the way that is <hi>Everlaſting.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore, Let not theſe things Diſcourage you, But let them Enflame our Care, Zeal, Endeavours and Deſires; That we may <hi>Watch,</hi> Becauſe Nothing con be done, when our Lord comes, but only, <hi>They that are Ready, Go in with Him to the Wedding.</hi>

                  <p>I Have now, by the Space of Fourteen, or <hi>Two Weeks</hi> of Years, been Serving for that Beautiful-<hi>Rachel</hi>-State of the Church of Chriſt, in the place of that <hi>Rachel in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, weeping for her Children in Sackcloth,</hi> and under Death; and would not be <hi>comforted,</hi> Becauſe <hi>They were not.</hi> I have ſet my ſelf all along, by Meditation, and Supplication to <hi>the Father of Lights,</hi> to <hi>ſearch out,</hi> and by the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Spirit of Prophecy,</hi> to Find, <hi>What,</hi> or <hi>What Manner of Time the Spirit of Chriſt did ſignify,</hi> for the Fullfilling that Grand Petition of his Servants; <hi>Thy Kingdom come, That thy Name may be Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> and <hi>Thy Will done, as in Heaven, and upon Earth;</hi> and I am now <hi>Wrestling</hi> to the <hi>Break of Day,</hi> and I Hope, the <hi>Dawn of the Morning,</hi> and Reſolv'd, not to <hi>Let Go,</hi> Till I obtain <hi>the Bleſſing of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Time, that from the Firſt, and throughout, it pleaſed the <hi>Lord of Time</hi> to fix upon my Mind, as the Time of That <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> Entring into its <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> and Preparation for its Glory, was, and is, This Approaching 1697. A Year, to which I could have no Temptation, either in Regard of Nearneſs, or Diſtance, or on any Account whatever, but as a <hi>Scripture-Line of Time,</hi> and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41902:99"/> Concurrent Reaſons of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> very many, and in a Series, and Continuation have Led me.</p>
                  <p>On this Foundation, having Setled, I have by Gracious Vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafements of Help from God, Turn'd my Self to All the Grand <hi>Prophetick</hi> Points of Scripture; and Found New Confirmations, and have Given as Publick Accounts of them, as I could attain, and preſented ſome of Them to Your Selves, and to the Great Councel of the Nation: And in as much as Supreme Goodneſs hath Granted me to Set up an <hi>Eben Ezer,</hi> now at the Portal of 97. I have Thought it my Duty to offer this <hi>Apology</hi> for the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> ſo near Approaching; And that The Great <hi>Iſaac, The Son of Promiſe,</hi> of Univerſal <hi>Laughter</hi> and Rejoycing, <hi>The Deſire of all Nations</hi> will Appear at a <hi>Set Time</hi> this Next Year, the very Laſt of thoſe Three <hi>Set Seaſons, Time, Times, Half Time;</hi> Eleven Times ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, or Vertually Recorded in <hi>Scripture Prophecy;</hi> and therefore I can have no Doubt; But in the obſerving Theſe ſo often Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions, Remarking cloſe upon Them, and on what Accounts They are Recalled, and to what Applied; and Ballancing Theſe, One with Another, I have Arriv'd to Full Aſſurance, They are Aſſign'd to the <hi>Papal</hi> Laſt State of the <hi>Roman Monarchy,</hi> the Laſt of the <hi>Four Kingdoms,</hi> or <hi>Monarchies</hi> (and the Four) now Expiring in the Expiration of <hi>Theſe Times</hi> and <hi>Half.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed I look upon no Truth of Scripture to be more Plain and Certain, except the Articles of Faith, and Rules of Holy Practice neceſſary to Salvation, Then that Thoſe <hi>Four Monarchies</hi> are given as a Calendar of Time for the Embarraſsment of the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> or that Glorious State of Chriſtianity, which even the <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> ſtyl'd, <hi>Eſtabliſh'd by Law,</hi> oblige the Belief, Deſire, and Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of: Scripture takes therefore ſo particular Notice of the <hi>Four, viz.</hi> the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> and <hi>Perfian;</hi> as is well known; and Takes Account of Their Time; of the <hi>Grecian</hi> more obſcurely; Yet the very New Teſtament, in that Language, and the ſo often Diviſion of the People of that Time, into <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> is a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Owning Them, as one of <hi>the Monarchies;</hi> Out of which, through a Great Part of the 70 <hi>Weeks,</hi> the State of the World had been ſliding into the <hi>Fourth,</hi> the <hi>Roman Monarchy,</hi> which Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds the whole <hi>New Teſtament Hiſtory,</hi> and <hi>Prophecy,</hi> as is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable.</p>
                  <p>But aſſoon as ever the Time allowed to the laſt of theſe is at an End, <hi>The Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> will immediately ſucceed, and there
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41902:99"/> can be no <hi>Inter-Reign;</hi> Nor can any other <hi>Kingdom</hi> Interpoſe: <hi>The Viſion is ſo ſure, and its Interpretation ſo certain;</hi> And ſuch a kind of Kingdom it muſt be, as was Congenially to have its ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion ſo Connexed to thoſe before it, that tho it is a Holy, a Heavenly, a Spiritual, yet it muſt be alſo a Viſible, Senſible King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as to the Dominion, and Glory of it, and no Metaphor, or Allegorical ſenſe can ſatisfy without it: And we know the Nations, to which we belong, are a part of the Ancient <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> and Remaine ſtill of the <hi>Ten,</hi> into which it was canton'd; Which Diviſion hath been to me an Infallible Reaſon of Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>France</hi> ſhould no more prevail to an <hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>I have the ſame aſſurance, that this <hi>Time, Times,</hi> and <hi>Half Time,</hi> muſt be juſt on the Expiration; By <hi>Prophecy,</hi> we might rather have expected their End ſooner; The Wiſdom of the Divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit draws them ſo very near to the Time of the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> Becoming Chriſtian in all its Portraitures of the <hi>Anti-chriſtian</hi> State (As I know my ſelf able, by Divine Aſſiſtance to make out to the ſatisfaction of Any, that will allow themſelves the thought, they know, and yield neceſſary in any more retired Parts of <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>) That had I not the Faithful Evidence of the <hi>Scripture Line of Time,</hi> (I have already mention'd) together with unconteſtable Events; I ſhould Fourteen Years ago have pitch'd upon ſome nearer Time; For (to mention one of the moſt obvious) the very Caſting the 1260, and Additional 75 ſo manifeſtly into Indictions, or Fifteens of Years, a Character of Time, not Regulated and known till ſoon after <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> would have Enclin'd to have commenced them ſooner.</p>
                  <p>I know, the <hi>Hope,</hi> for which I <hi>Apologize</hi> cannot, but Encounter Great Objections, but I am aſſured, God hath ſet it, and myſelf as a Miniſter of it, as a <hi>Brazen Wall,</hi> that tho it be <hi>Fought againſt,</hi> It ſhall not be <hi>prevail'd</hi> over.</p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:41902:100"/>
                  <p>The Objections, and Solutions, I ſhall very much in ſhort thus Account for: Firſt, It will be pretended againſt it; It is a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous Curioſity to undertake to Pry into <hi>Prophetick Times,</hi> and that it ought to be immediately check'd with that of our Lord; <hi>It is not for you to know the Times, and Seaſons which the Father hath Set in his own Power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as to that Particular Scripture, it is evident, it was an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune Enquiry of the Apoſtles, not in the order of Scripture Reſearches, nor in the due waiting for of the promiſe of the Spirit, which was the Duty of that very Juncture; And therefore tho our Lord is quick upon their diſorderly queſtion, yet he implies, there would be a Gracious method for their Reſolution in it, and commands them to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to wait for <hi>The promiſe of the Spirit from the Father,</hi> which ſaith He, you have heard of me, One Branch of which was, <hi>The ſhewing them things to come,</hi> Joh. 16. 14. And in general, we find the ſearch of <hi>Prophetick Times,</hi> is much more under the Favour, then the Diſpleaſure of Scripture; It is recorded with Honour to the <hi>Children of</hi> Iſſachar, <hi>that they had underſtanding of Times, and knew what</hi> Iſrael <hi>was to do;</hi> Particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">1 Chron. 2. 32.</note> concerning <hi>Davids Kingdom,</hi> which was the concernment of that Time; And in which I doubt not, they laid together the Prediction of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and other Revelations of God peculiar to that People, and thoſe Times, by which they were able to give a Judgment: And it is obſerved, <hi>Their Brethren were at their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;</hi> This ſway'd no doubt in the Union of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>David:</hi> The Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> was not ſatisfied with what he found by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate<note place="margin">C. 9. 1.</note> Revelation, but underſtood by <hi>Books of Scripture,</hi> and civil Records (It is a Recommendation of that method) <hi>the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Years God had Determin'd for the Deſolations of the Sanctuary;</hi> The Prophets in the ſame manner ſearch'd, <hi>What and what manner of Time, the Spirit which was in them did ſignify;</hi> The Apoſtle by<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 11.</note> the Spirit Praiſes the <hi>Giving heed to the ſure Word of Prophecy, as doing well.</hi> Seeing then the Account of Time is one eminent Branch of that <hi>ſure Word,</hi> It is Praiſe-worthy <hi>to give heed</hi> to that, and no Preſumption to do ſo: Our Lord charges it as <hi>Hypocriſy,</hi> not to diſcern <hi>the Signs of the Times,</hi> thoſe Characters and Notes of Impreſſion God hath ſet upon them by <hi>Prophecy:</hi> How often is there Encouragement given in that Great <hi>Prophecy</hi> of the New Teſtament, <hi>Bleſſed is he that Readeth, and they that hear the Words of the Prophecy of this Book. Let Him that hath Wiſdom Count.</hi> Here<note place="margin">

                  <p>It may be further Argued againſt the Defining of Time from <hi>Scripture-Prophecy;</hi> That the Scripture-Prophecies are ſo Dark, and <hi>Enigmatical,</hi> that it appears moſt probable; The Spirit of God did not intend, They ſhould be underſtood, or Laid Open, till the very End of All Things, at the <hi>Day of Judgment,</hi> or in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven in Eternity; And therefore, The Sobereſt, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt Men, though very Learned, and of Great Sagaciouſneſs, do not engage themſelves therein, and Leaſt of All in the Accounts of Time.</p>
                  <p>To This I would, by way of Defence, Rejoyn in the Firſt Place; That it is moſt True, That in the Darkneſs of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State, while the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> of the <hi>Papal</hi> State ſo much Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Glory of Chriſtianity, There is a Great Indiſpoſition, and a Great Inability to Interpret <hi>Scripture-Prophecies; The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned ſay, They are not Learned;</hi> and the <hi>Learned ſay, The Book</hi>

And this will in a very Great Meaſure continue, till the Kingdom of Chriſt come into tis Succeſſion, that the <hi>Ears of the Deaf ſhall hear the Words of this Book, and the Eyes of the Blind ſee out of obſcurity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But yet, in the ſecond place, it is undeniable, That which is moſt <hi>Enigmatical,</hi> and under what we call <hi>Riddle,</hi> if it be wiſely contriv'd, and deſign'd, muſt have ſenſe under it, tho not ſo open, but that it ſhall require cloſe Attendance, the moſt Exerciſed Thought; And on thoſe Terms it is ſo prepar'd, that it may be underſtood, and excellent Senſe found under it, tho a <hi>Riddle. Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Riddle</hi> had a very certain Determinate ſenſe, and if we knew fully the meaning of it, advances beyond the Firſt Unriddling, very admirable Inſtructions; All retired Parts of Knowledge in <hi>Anatomy, Aſtronomy, Mathematicks, Algebra,</hi> Call for Underſtandings peculiarly fitted to them, and moſt attent Application, and Curious Inſtruments, <hi>Microſcopes, Teleſcopes;</hi> and yet the Knowledge, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41902:101"/> Aſſurance, that riſes from them, when underſtood is the moſt Refined and Satisfactory: And ſo it is in <hi>Prophecy</hi> of Scripture, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho it does not offer it ſelf at ſo eaſie a Rate, as ſome other Points of Scripture-Knowledge; Yet by deep and fixed Meditation, by comparing of its parts, one with another, and eſpecially waiting upon the <hi>Spirit of Prophecy</hi> for its <hi>Illumination,</hi> we ſhall find, it is prepar'd, and weigh'd out with the greateſt Severity of Truth, Divine Senſe, and leads into very ſublime Diſcoveries of Divine Wiſdom in the Government of the World, in Relation to his Church, the Times and Seaſons of it; And tends to the Greateſt Aws of God, and obedience to the Supreme Majeſty of Heaven, and Earth, and to know, <hi>That he is God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Third Place, It is affirm'd by the Spirit of God, that it is intended, it ſhould be underſtood; For it affirms, 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 19, 20. It is a Light that ſhines in a Dark Place,</hi> Now if it be darker, than the <hi>Dark Place,</hi> How can it be call'd a <hi>Light?</hi> Or how can it enlighten ſuch a Dark place? And it is not of <hi>Private Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> as I have heretofore given an Account publickly; The very meaning is, It is not of a Reſerv'd, or Apart-Interpretation; As it is ſaid, <hi>Chriſt privately, or apart Interpreted his Parables to his Diſciples.</hi> God ſays of Himſelf, <hi>Eſa. 45. 19. I have not ſpoken in ſecret, or in a Dark Place of the Earth, like the Dark dubious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Devils: I</hi> Jehovah <hi>ſpeak Righteouſneſs; I declare the things that are Right, of Greateſt Sincerity, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs and Truth,</hi> not perplex'd, but <hi>plain to them that underſtand moſt Right, Straight, and direct, to Him that underſtandeth; Right to them, that find know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; And I have not ſaid,</hi> ſaith our God, <hi>to any of the Seed of</hi> Jacob, <hi>Seek ye my Face in Vain,</hi> Even for the underſtanding of the <hi>Prophecies</hi> of my Word; And in the very ſame Chapter, God Encourages to <hi>Ask of Him Things to Come;</hi> Even, as his <hi>Spirit</hi> is ſaid to ſhew to his Servants <hi>Things to Come:</hi> All which I hope, will appear a ſufficient Anſwer to the Suſpicion; That God gave the <hi>Propheſies</hi> of his Word, and ſo Eminent a Part of them; <hi>Numbers of Time;</hi> and did not intend, they ſhould be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
                  <p>If it be taken as in this very Joinct, and Objected, How comes it to paſs? That All, who hitherto have Writ on <hi>Prophetical</hi> Scripture, have much differed one from another, and they who Fix'd Time, have either liv'd to ſee themſelves miſtaken, or it hath appear'd after their Death, They have been ſo: I deſire, it

                     </gap> And as to their Miſtakes, in Point of Time, It is to be Allowed, Their Diſtances, ſome of Them, from the Time of Completion, might be their Diſadvantage; God not vouchſafing ſuch Light concerning that Time, till nearer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; as not to <hi>Daniel,</hi> but upon the very Year of the 70 Years Ending.</p>
                  <p>It is further to be conſidered; That there are ſome Eminent and Learned Perſons, who have, though upon ſomewhat Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Grounds, yet concentred upon this very 97. and ſome ſo near it, as upon 98, 99, and eſpecially 1700. That their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations are yet (as I may ſay) in Abeyance; and Things moſt probably will be ſo Conducted, as eaſily to Reconcile ſo ſmall Diſagreements, by the Firſt Breakings out of Light, and further Illuſtrations.</p>
                  <p>But Herein I Humbly Magnifie, and Adore the Freeneſs of Grace, and Divine Aſſiſtance to his Unworthieſt Servant; That He hath Granted to me, to Lay before me, the Whole and Entire <hi>Prophetical Table</hi> of his Word, which is the Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Security againſt Miſtake, that can be vouchſafed: Becauſe by the View and Survey of things together, They are ſeen in their Juſt Scituations, and Allowances of Room, and placed Equally, one in proportion to another; That there may be no Croud, Confuſion, Juſtle upon, or Interfere one with another: Whereas, if this be not, a plauſible Semblance, or Sound of Agreement may miſlead.</p>
                  <p>If ſuch a <hi>Scheme</hi> be Reflected upon, as Imaginary, and the Work of Fancy, I make an Humble Challenge to all the Wit, the Fancy, the Learning that is in the World, to Give a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel Scheme in ſuch an Agreement with the Word of God, and the Providential Events in Concert with it; By which I am aſſured, It is not, nor cannot be my own, but as Found in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writings; ſeeing Fancy and Imagination cannot create in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Self-ſubſiſtent Things; or Erect into undoubted matter of

                  <p>Now from hence, reach the Additional 75, to the <hi>Thouſand</hi> Years of the <hi>Bleſſed State, Viz.</hi> From the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> in Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, in Thirty years of the <hi>Sealed Thunders,</hi> opened in <hi>Rev.</hi> c. 14.

                  <p>And in the ſame way of Evidence, and Aſſurance, I find my ſelf through the Gracious Aſſiſtance of God, able to go backward in the <hi>Analytical,</hi> or Retrograde method to the very <hi>Death of Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>

                  <p>For The Anſwer I would give, is, Becauſe God hath engaged my Heart and Thoughts to this Inquiry; And it hath been the Principal Subject of my Intellectual Inquiries, though I hope not in a Neglect of other Points of <hi>Theology,</hi> and Scripture-Knowledge; But by this means I have been looking every way into All the Advertiſements of <hi>Scripture-Prophecy,</hi> comparing <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Things with Prophetical,</hi> and any of the moſt Accurate Memoirs of Hiſtory and <hi>Chronology,</hi> I could Arrain; And This is no other, than what Any Other Studious in theſe Things, might have Attained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and much Higher, according to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Learning, more enlarged Capacities of Mind, Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Expreſſion; as is moſt experimental in that Excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>The Annotator on the Revelation,</hi> and his <hi>Annotations,</hi> Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed about Four Years ago; The Only Thing that I pretend to, of Peculiar Favour herein from the Moſt High, is, That he hath thus engaged my Heart, and Thoughts to <hi>ſeparate my ſelf,</hi> and to <hi>Intermeddle with this Wiſdom,</hi> and Aſſiſted me ſo far therein.</p>

                  <p>To this I Anſwer, It will eaſily be allowed that the Divine Spirit hath Determin'd, and knows according to that its Expreſſion of it ſelf, to the very <hi>Self ſame Day;</hi> And therefore, ſeeing it hath given <hi>Numbers</hi> of Time, it muſt be to the very <hi>Self ſame Day,</hi> For the end of every <hi>Number</hi> is ſo Preciſe, and Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite; That It muſt needs be to the very <hi>Self ſame Year,</hi> and even Day, if we could have, as Punctual Account of Days, as of Years; But I find not the Holy Spirit ordinarily, is more particular then Days of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41902:107"/> Years: By therefore a due Poize of that Trine Aſpect, of <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Emblems, Prophetick Numbers,</hi> and Providential Effects in Event, and Matters of Fact; of the Records of which, It hath taken Care by General <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> and <hi>Chronology,</hi> we may come to know to a Year; And of this, Beſides ſeveral other Aſſurances that Require more Diſcourſe, There is that Time of the Reformation more Eaſy, and Immediate to every Obſervation; wherein Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Super-Intendencies upon all <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> concerning it, to Fix the Beginnings of it in 1517. does ſo aſſure the Beginning of: <hi>Half Time,</hi> as to aſſure alſo the End of <hi>Half Time,</hi> as of an 180 Years, and ſo of <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Times</hi> at 1697. and therefore the Beginning of <hi>Times,</hi> or the <hi>Two Times</hi> at 797. and of the <hi>Firſt Time</hi> at 437. The <hi>Times, and Half,</hi> are contrived therefore into ſuch Large <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons of Time,</hi> as <hi>One Time, Two Times</hi> and <hi>Half a Time,</hi> that They may be ſeen in ſo Large Spaces, and ſo much together; and yet in ſuch Minute, Exact Diviſions, as <hi>Days of Years,</hi> eſpecially and on purpoſe, that they might be fully known, and exactly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood all along, and at the <hi>End.</hi> which with ſo many Concurrences before-nam'd, (and of which I ſhould be moſt Ready to Give the particular State, more at large, to a Free and Deſirous, and a Judicious Recipient) does not make it ſtrange to determine ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly upon 97. and may free from that Objection.</p>
                  <p>But what is there of Preparation to ſo great a Change? or what <hi>Inſtruments</hi> in view for ſuch <hi>Effects?</hi> may it be ſaid. To which, this Anſwer is to be given: That when we have to do with Him, who <hi>Planted the Heavens, and Laid the Foundations of the Earth: who telleth the Number of the Stars, and calleth them All by their Names; and appoints them every one their Courſe, to Fight in;</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is Hard. Or how wonderful ſoever it be in our Eyes, can it be ſo in His? <hi>Who works his ſigns, and his wonders in Heaven, and on Earth; and none can stay his Hand, or ſay unto him, what do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou? who works, and none can let it: Hath he ſpoken, and ſhall he not do it? Is Any Thing too hard for me, ſath our Jehovah?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as to <hi>Means and Inſtruments,</hi> altho he could raiſe them, if he pleas'd; Yet His <hi>Word of Propheby</hi> ſo expreſſes the doing of it, as if he would make uſe of No Hand but his own; The <hi>Stone cut out of the Mountain is not in Hands;</hi> That Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that ſtands up <hi>againſt the Prince of Princes, ſhall be broken without Hand.</hi> Now this <hi>without Hand,</hi> is a manner of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Spirit of God is pleaſed, as by the <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of it from <hi>Daniel,</hi> into the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> to <hi>Apply</hi> a <hi>Tabernacle made without
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41902:107"/> Hands, the Circumciſion without Hands; the Houſe not made with Hands, Eternal in the Heavens,</hi> appears to be an Expreſſion of God work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by an Immediate Power of his own, and by Himſelf. It is by a Spirit of <hi>Life from God,</hi> and by a <hi>Voice from Heaven.</hi> The <hi>Four Wheels of the Four Monarchies</hi> are brought into the <hi>Temple,</hi> under the <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims;</hi> and without any more ado, <hi>It was cried concerning them in my Hearing</hi> (the <hi>Hearing</hi> of the Servants of God) <hi>Oh Revolution!</hi> It immediately paſs'd upon them All, and there were <hi>Loud Voices in Heaven</hi> upon it, proclaiming that <hi>Revolution: The Kingdoms of this World are bocome the Kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Chriſt.</hi> And this is done at <hi>Half Time</hi> Ending, which ſignifies <hi>Suddenneſs, and Surpriſe:</hi> When this is done, He, who does it, <hi>Comes with ſtrong Hand; His Arm Rules for Him.</hi> He underſtands his own Work; In the midſt of All the Perplexities of it, <hi>His work is before him;</hi> He underſtands it perfectly and throughout, Every Spring, every Wheel to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, Every Pin of Connexion.</p>
                  <p>But that which may much indeed Terrify, and Diſcourage, is the Great Unworthineſs of All Sorts and Degrees of Men, of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and even of Churches; ſo that ſome very <hi>Sweeping Judgment,</hi> and <hi>Deſolation</hi> rather, or, at leaſt, is firſt to be expected.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Hope</hi> yet is, That <hi>when God works for his Kingdom,</hi> and ſeems to be <hi>Lifting up his Hand to Deſtroy, He will work for his own Names ſake,</hi> in a <hi>Deliverance.</hi> He will conſider, He, to whom the <hi>Kingdom is to be Given,</hi> is worthy: And when the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Covenant,</hi> comes into his <hi>Temple,</hi> He does not expect to find <hi>Refinement</hi> ready to his Hand, but He comes to <hi>Refine:</hi> He hath given an Example in the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>All Long-ſuffering and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi> eſpecially prepared for that very Time; Thoſe, who ſhall <hi>Hereafter,</hi> in a great diſtance of Time, <hi>Believe on Him; His Reward is with Him.</hi> He expects it only from Himſelf, <hi>when his work ie ſo before him.</hi> And even to <hi>Impenitents</hi> there is firſt a time of <hi>Warning and Teſtimony,</hi> and then <hi>the Day that will Burn as an Ouen,</hi> and the <hi>wicked are as Aſhes under the Soles of the Feet.</hi> After this <hi>warning</hi> is the <hi>perdition of ungodly Men reſerv'd for puniſhment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know very well, Notwithſtanding, all this Aſſurance, and the Reaſon of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have given; It will be ſaid yet to me; Seeing this Year 97 is in ſo near on Approach, and there are no Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of ſuch a Succeſſion, or opening of the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> ought it not therefore to ſhake your Confidence, and put a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon ſuch a continued Affirmation of ſuch a Kingdom to make any Entrance at this Time?</p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:41902:108"/>
                  <p>In Anſwer to this, I would make this Humble Profeſſion, or Confeſſion in theſe Three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I cannot be ſhaken in my aſſurance; Becauſe I find my Grounds in the Word of God unſhakable, and unmoveable; A <hi>Falſe Witneſs,</hi> that hath no Foundation, Periſheth in this Senſe; He cannot Bear up to, nor continue in his Teſtimony; But, <hi>He that Heareth,</hi> and knows, on what Grounds He ſpeaks, <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth conſtantly:</hi> He that hath <hi>ſeen nothing,</hi> as the Ground of his <hi>Prophecy</hi> is like a <hi>Reed ſhaken with the Wind;</hi> But they, that <hi>have the Word of the Lord,</hi> Continue to ſpeak it: While I am ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, The <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> Enters its Succeſſion without any delay, whenever the Laſt of the <hi>Four Kingdoms</hi> Ends; That the <hi>Third Woe</hi> of the <hi>Seventh Angel,</hi> that Sounds the Kingdom of Chriſt, <hi>Cometh quickly;</hi> I look to ſee therefore, what aſſurances there are, this Laſt <hi>Kingdom,</hi> even its Laſt State is upon giving up. I find then, the <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Half,</hi> Which are the Term of the Laſt State, of the Laſt <hi>Kingdom;</hi> By the Time ſince <hi>Conſtantine;</hi> By the Time, ſince the <hi>Chriſtian Empire</hi> Demiſed; By the Time ſince <hi>Mahometaniſm,</hi> and more Particularly the <hi>Ottoman Empire</hi> hath entred the World; By the Time, ſince the <hi>Reformation</hi> firſt entred by <hi>Luther,</hi> juſt end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. All theſe have ſuch Lively Sculptures and Engravings, in the <hi>Sure word of Prophecy,</hi> and their Times ſo Delineated; I do not better know the Courſe of the Months in the Year; the Days in the Month, or the Hours in the Day, then I know the very Laſt Year of the 1260 Days of Years, is now entring, and to Run its Circle; and that within its Circle, the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> will come into its Succeſſion.</p>
                  <p>The Second thing, that I moſt Humbly deſire to be Stedfaſt, Unmoveable, Unſhaken in, and upon, is the Exceeding Riches of the Grace, and Loving Kindneſs of God in Jeſus Chriſt, the Great <hi>High Prieſt, and Apoſtle of my Profeſſion;</hi> That <hi>Shepherd</hi> of the <hi>Sheep,</hi> that is to <hi>Shine forth</hi> as the Great <hi>Prince,</hi> to have That great <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, that Fold, that is a Court, <hi>One Shepherd, and One Fold:</hi> the Goodneſs and Faithfulneſs of the <hi>Spirit of Truth, Guiding into all Truth: Glorifying the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by taking of the Things,</hi> That are His, and ſo of his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and <hi>ſhewing</hi> them to his Servants, and <hi>ſhewing</hi> them <hi>Things that are to Come;</hi> I have Great Aſſurance in his Tendereſt Mercies, having Led, and Guided, and Supported me thus far, in the Search after his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and Manifeſted ſo much to me; He will not Leave me to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41902:108"/> be aſhamed of my Hope; I can Humbly ſay before Him, as his Servant <hi>Jeremy; Oh Lord; thy Words have been Found, and I have Eaten them, and they have been the Joy and the Rejoycing of my Heart,</hi> I Humbly therefore Expoſtulate with Him, <hi>Wilt Thou? Wilt Thou be to me as a Lyar;</hi> I know it is Impoſſible, <hi>He ſhould Lye, He is God, that cannot Lye;</hi> And therefore herein His Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants may plead with Him; The <hi>Viſion</hi> ſhall not <hi>Lye,</hi> He will not be, as <hi>Waters, that are not ſure,</hi> of which he hath given ſo Lively a Deſcription, in comparing the Unfaithfulneſs of Friends to Them; <hi>My Friends have dealt Deceitfully with me,</hi> as a <hi>Brook,</hi> and as the <hi>Streams of Waters, that paſs away; Which are Blackiſh by Reaſon of Ice,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But what Time they are warm, They Vaniſh, when it is Hot, They are Conſumed out of their Place; the Paths of their way are turned aſide,</hi> They go <hi>to nothing, and Periſh; The Troops of</hi> Tema, <hi>Looked, and VVaited; The Companies</hi> of Seba <hi>were Confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, Becauſe they had Hoped, they came thither, and were Aſhamed,</hi> Jer. 15. 15. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Job. 15. 15. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How fully does this Expreſs, what <hi>Jeremy</hi> underſtood by Waters <hi>not ſure!</hi> And how Applicable to My Caſe, if the Hopes I have of the Kingdom of Chriſt, ſhould prove miſtaken.</p>
                  <p>It may be ſaid, Indeed if I were ſure, I had the Right Senſe of <hi>Scripture-Prophecy,</hi> the Argument were enough ſure; I therefore herein Rely on his Grace, that he hath Guided me into the Truth of his Word; that as I am ſure, <hi>His Word cannot Fail; He cannot Lie;</hi> ſo neither can any <hi>Iron,</hi> any Created Power break the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Iron,</hi> or prepared Steel of his Wiſdom, Truth and Power.</p>
                  <p>But leſt any ſhould ſay, <hi>If you have ſuch a Fasth, have it to your ſelf before God, and Happy are you, if you do not find Reaſon to Condemn your ſelf in what you ſo much approve:</hi> This therefore is my <hi>Third Profeſſion,</hi> The things that I have ſo heard and ſeen by continual ſearch into, Meditation upon, and ſeeking Divine Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I cannot but ſpeak; I look upon the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> as of thoſe Things wherein we ſhould <hi>confeſs Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>not be aſhamed of him before Men,</hi> whoſo deſpiſe <hi>his Kingdom;</hi> and of thoſe, of which <hi>Confeſſion is to be made with the Mouth uneo Salvation.</hi> And therefore, as I have Humble Hopes, That Jeſus Chriſt hath been Graciouſly pleas'd to draw out my Heart, Thoughts, Meditations, to ſearch <hi>Every Retirement</hi> of his Word therein above All, that have been before me; And to give me Greater Confidence and Aſſurance; and a more open Profeſſion and Publication of what
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41902:109"/> I have Found; So that he will graciouſly <hi>Accept, Remember, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, ſpare me</hi> through the <hi>Multitude</hi> of his Mercies, and not deliver up to ſhame, and Confuſion of Face before Men, and confeſs me <hi>before his Father,</hi> and before <hi>his Holy Angels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That ſuch a State of his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and ſuch a Revolution with it, and by it, ſhall this very Year Appear to All the World, as hath never been ſince the <hi>Apoſtacy of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> and that therefore All Mighty Works ſhall ſhew forth Themſelves in it: <hi>The Spirit ſhall be poured out from on High; The Wilderneſs ſhall Become a Fruitful Field; viz.</hi> in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Purity, and Proſperity of his Churches; and <hi>that, which look'd like a Fruitful Field, become Deſert,</hi> even the Antichriſtian State, and whatever partakes of it, the Glory of <hi>All</hi> this World, and the Grandeur of it; and ſo the <hi>Everlaſting Goſpel</hi> ſhall be <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to every Nation, Tongue and People,</hi> and every Thing move to the Glory of that Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>To whom then (Moſt Reverend, and Right Reverend) could I preſent equally, as to you, the conſideration of theſe things, who, I am aſſured are ſo Richly Furniſhed with all Advantages of Learning, both in that <hi>Sure word of Prophecy,</hi> and in <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> and <hi>Chronology,</hi> Correſpondent therewith; And whoſe very Title Imports the Office of Thoſe, who are on the <hi>VVatch Tower,</hi> waiting for the <hi>Speaking of the Viſion,</hi> which will not Tarry beyond its Time; And therefore ſhould be able to Anſwer the Queſtion, <hi>VVatchman, VVatchman, what of the Night?</hi> Or how <hi>Near</hi> is the <hi>Morning?</hi> and who, as Perſons of an Elevated Station, ought to Vindicate your ſelves by a Higher Zeal for the Kingdom of Chriſt, and even by a Holy Haſte to bring Him to his Throne above others; That you may not Fall under any Ombrage of the <hi>Anti-christian Hierarchy,</hi> who as <hi>Feet of Clay,</hi> are found in the Undermine of the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt;</hi> and are Broken by the very Firſt Openings of it, as upon which that <hi>Image</hi> Reſts, that Stands in delay of that <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How therefore ſhould you be able to anſwer that Queſtion, <hi>What do you more than others for the Kingdom of the Chief Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, who hath it on his Veſture, and on his Thigh, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords?</hi> and who Profeſs to Attend upon him more Near and in Ordinary.</p>
